## Peak-End Rule

- People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.

### Takeaways
1. Pay close attention to the most intense points and the final moments (the “end”) of the user journey.
2. Identify the moments when your product is most helpful, valuable, or entertaining and design to delight the end user.
3. Remember that people recall negative experiences more vividly than positive ones.
