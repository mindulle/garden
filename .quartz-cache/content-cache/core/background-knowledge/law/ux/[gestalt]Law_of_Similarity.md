## Law of Similarity

- The human eye tends to perceive similar elements in a design as a complete picture, shape, or group, even if those elements are separated.

### Takeaways
1. Elements that are visually similar will be perceived as related.
2. Color, shape, and size, orientation and movement can signal that elements belong to the same group and likely share a common meaning or functionality.
3. Ensure that links and navigation systems are visually differentiated from normal text elements.
