## Law of Uniform Connectedness

- Elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than elements with no connection.

### Takeaways
1. Group functions of a similar nature so they are visually connected via colors, lines, frames, or other shapes.
2. Alternately, you can use a tangible connecting reference (line, arrow, etc) from one element to the next to also create a visual connection.
3. Use uniform connectedness to show context or to emphasize the relationship between similar items.
