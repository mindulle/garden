## Jakobâ€™s Law

- Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

### Takeaways
1. Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that appears similar.
2. By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the users can focus on their tasks rather than on learning new models.
3. When making changes, minimize discord by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited time.
