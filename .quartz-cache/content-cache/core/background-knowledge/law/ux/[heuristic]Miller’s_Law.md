## Miller’s Law

- The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.

### Takeaways
1. Don’t use the “magical number seven” to justify unnecessary design limitations.
2. Organize content into smaller chunks to help users process, understand, and memorize easily.
3. Remember that short-term memory capacity will vary per individual, based on their prior knowledge and situational context.
