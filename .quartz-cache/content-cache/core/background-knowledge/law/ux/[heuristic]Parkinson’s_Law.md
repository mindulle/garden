## Jakob’s Law

- Any task will inflate until all of the available time is spent.

### Takeaways
1. Limit the time it takes to complete a task to what users expect it’ll take.
2. Reducing the actual duration to complete a task from the expected duration will improve the overall user experience.
3. Leverage features such as autofill to save the user time when providing critical information within forms. This allows for quick completion of purchases, bookings and other such functions while preventing task inflation.
