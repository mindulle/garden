## Doherty Threshold

- Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (<400ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other.

### Takeaways
1. Provide system feedback within 400 ms in order to keep usersâ€™ attention and increase productivity.
2. Use perceived performance to improve response time and reduce the perception of waiting.
3. Animation is one way to visually engage people while loading or processing is happening in the background.
4. Progress bars help make wait times tolerable, regardless of their accuracy.
5. Purposefully adding a delay to a process can actually increase its perceived value and instill a sense of trust, even when the process itself actually takes much less time.
