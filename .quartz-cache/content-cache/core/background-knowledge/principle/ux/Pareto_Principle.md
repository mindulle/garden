## Pareto Principle

- The Pareto principle states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

### Takeaways
1. Inputs and outputs are often not evenly distributed.
2. A large group may contain only a few meaningful contributors to the desired outcome.
3. Focus the majority of effort on the areas that will bring the largest benefits to the most users.
