## Postelâ€™s Law

- Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.

### Takeaways
1. Be empathetic to, flexible about, and tolerant of any of the various actions the user could take or any input they might provide.
2. Anticipate virtually anything in terms of input, access, and capability while providing a reliable and accessible interface.
3. The more we can anticipate and plan for in design, the more resilient the design will be.
4. Accept variable input from users, translating that input to meet your requirements, defining boundaries for input, and providing clear feedback to the user.
