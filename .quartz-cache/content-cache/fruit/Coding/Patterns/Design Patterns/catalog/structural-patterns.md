# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

|   *[[fruit/Coding/Patterns/Design Patterns/catalog/structural/adapter\|Adapter]]*<br/>![50](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/adapter-mini.png)   | Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.                                                                                                                           |
|    *[[fruit/Coding/Patterns/Design Patterns/catalog/structural/bridge\|Bridge]]*<br/>![50](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/bridge-mini.png)    | Lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies---abstraction and implementation---which can be developed independently of each other. |
|   *[[fruit/Coding/Patterns/Design Patterns/catalog/structural/composite\|Composite]]*![50](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/composite-mini.png)    | Lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.                                                                 |
| *[[fruit/Coding/Patterns/Design Patterns/catalog/structural/decorator\|Decorator]]*<br/>![50](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/decorator-mini.png) | Lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.                                                          |
|    *[[fruit/Coding/Patterns/Design Patterns/catalog/structural/facade\|Facade]]*<br/>![50](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/facade-mini.png)    | Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.                                                                                       |
| *[[fruit/Coding/Patterns/Design Patterns/catalog/structural/flyweight\|Flyweight]]*<br/>![50](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/flyweight-mini.png) | Lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.               |
|     *[[fruit/Coding/Patterns/Design Patterns/catalog/structural/proxy\|Proxy]]*<br/>![50](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/cards/proxy-mini.png)     | Lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
