## 1.13 Other generic good testing hygiene

:white_check_mark: **Do:** This post is focused on testing advice that is related to or at least can be exemplified with Node JS. This bullet, however, groups a few non-Node related tips that are well-known

Learn and practice [TDD principles](https://www.sm-cloud.com/book-review-test-driven-development-by-example-a-tldr/) — they are extremely valuable for many but don’t get intimidated if they don’t fit your style, you’re not the only one. Consider writing the tests before the code in a [red-green-refactor style](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.html), ensure each test checks exactly one thing, when you find a bug — before fixing write a test that will detect this bug in the future, and let each test fail at least once before turning green, start a module by writing a quick and simplistic code that satisfies the test - then refactor gradually and take it to a production grade level, avoid any dependency on the environment (paths, OS, etc)

❌ **Otherwise:** You‘ll miss pearls of wisdom that were collected for decades
