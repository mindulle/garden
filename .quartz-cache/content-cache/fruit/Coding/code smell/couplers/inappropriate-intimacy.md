> [!NOTE] Inappropriate Intimacy
> Sometimes classes become far too intimate and spend too much time delving into each othersâ€™ private parts. We may not be prudes when it comes to people, but we think our classes should follow strict, puritan rules. Over-intimate classes need to be broken up as lovers were in ancient days.
# Inappropriate Intimacy

### Signs and Symptoms

One class uses the internal fields and methods of another class.

### Reasons for the Problem

Keep a close eye on classes that spend too much time together. Good
classes should know as little about each other as possible. Such classes
are easier to maintain and reuse.

### Treatment

-   The simplest solution is to use [Move Method](/move-method) and
    [Move Field](/move-field) to move parts of one class to the class in
    which those parts are used. But this works only if the first class
    truly doesn't need these parts.

-   Another solution is to use [Extract Class](/extract-class) and [Hide
    Delegate](/hide-delegate) on the class to make the code relations
    "official".

-   If the classes are mutually interdependent, you should use [Change
    Bidirectional Association to
    Unidirectional](/change-bidirectional-association-to-unidirectional).

-   If this "intimacy" is between a subclass and the superclass,
    consider [Replace Delegation with
    Inheritance](/replace-delegation-with-inheritance).
