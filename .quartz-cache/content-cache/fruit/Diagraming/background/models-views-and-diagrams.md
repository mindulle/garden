# Models, Views, and Diagrams {#models-views-and-diagrams .title}




## What is a Model?

Models are often built in the context of business and IT systems in
order to better understand existing or future systems. However, a model
never fully corresponds to reality. Modeling always means *emphasizing*
and *omitting*: emphasizing essential details and omitting irrelevant
ones. But what is essential and what is irrelevant? There is no
universal answer to this question. Rather, the answer depends on *what*
the goals of the model are and *who* is viewing or reading it.

> Think about what is emphasized or omitted in the following models:
>
> -   A wind tunnel model of a car
> -   A model of a building scaled at 1:50
> -   A route plan of the subway
> -   A map
> -   An organization chart

The more information a model is supposed to give, the more complex and
difficult it becomes. A map of Europe, for example, that simultaneously
contains political, geological, demographic, and transportation-related
information is hardly legible. The solution to this problem is to convey
the different types of information on individual maps. *Different views*
are formed of the objects under consideration. These views are
interconnected in many ways. Generally, if one view is changed, all
other views have to be adjusted as well. If, for instance, in the
Netherlands new land is reclaimed from the North Sea, all
views---meaning all maps---have to be updated.

</figure>

The same is true for the model of a building. If a new wing is added to
an existing building various views are affected, including the floor
plan, the different exterior views, and the 3D-model made from wood.
Figure 2.3 illustrates this in a schematic manner. In *[The Models of
our Case
Study](/uml/basic-principles-and-background/the-models-of-our-case-study)*,
we specifically address the relationships between the models we use in
this book. The different views within each model are described in more
detail in *[Modeling Business Systems](/uml/modeling-business-systems)*,
*[Modeling IT Systems](/uml/modeling-it-systems)* and *[Modeling for
System Integration](/uml/modeling-for-system-integration)*.

## Why do we Need Models?

As a general rule, a model of a system has to perform the following
tasks:

-   **Communication** between all involved parties: In order to build
    the right system, it is essential that all involved parties think
    along the same lines. It is particularly important that everyone
    understands the terminology used, that customers agree upon the same
    requirements, that developers understand these requirements, and
    that the decisions made can still be understood months later.
-   **Visualization** of all facts for customers, experts, and users:
    All accumulated facts relevant to the system need to be presented in
    such a way that everyone concerned can understand them. However,
    according to our real-life experience, we often hit a wall of
    resistance when we want to communicate with diagrams instead of
    text. It is necessary to overcome this resistance. Behind it is
    often a fear of the unknown; and the diagrams might look a bit
    complicated at first. Therefore, this book contains directions on
    how to read each diagram.
-   **Verification** of facts in terms of completeness, consistency, and
    correctness: A (more or less) formal model makes it possible to
    verify the facts obtained for completeness, consistency, and
    correctness. In particular, the clear depiction of
    interrelationships makes it possible to ask specific questions, and
    to answer them. We will list these questions with each diagram.

> Answer the following questions for yourself:
>
> -   When was the last time you felt that you were at cross-purposes
>     when you discussed a system?
> -   When was the last time you felt that you were discussing the same
>     issue over and over again?
> -   When was the last time you wished that the consensus you reached
>     during a discussion had been recorded?

## Purpose and Target Group of a Model

In real life we often observe that the results of cumbersome, tedious,
and expensive modeling simply disappear in a stack of paper on someone's
desk. We might ask why this is so. Two factors greatly influence the
result of modeling: **for whom** do we create the model and **for what
purpose** is it supposed to be used. If we don't discuss and define
these aspects sufficiently, we run the risk of creating models that
don't contain what is important to the user. In other words, if details
are not emphasized and omitted appropriately, the model is rendered
worthless.

To define the purpose and target group the following questions should be
answered:

-   **How much business expertise can we expect?** Can we assume basic
    knowledge of the subject, or do we have to explain the fundamentals
    of the model's events and processes?
-   **What amount of detail does the target group need?** What level of
    complexity does the model permit? If processes and systems are
    subject to constant changes, a highly detailed model might be
    unrealistic. This is because, most of the time, it is not possible
    to maintain those models in a satisfactory manner. A less detailed
    model requires less effort to develop and update, but it is also
    less precise.
-   **How much time does the target group have** to read and interpret
    the model? Prevent your model from disappearing in a stack of paper
    on someone's desk by choosing the appropriate level of detail and
    complexity; otherwise, nobody might have enough time to read it.
-   **What language can be used in the model?** Does the target group
    understand technical business terms? Do they understand IT
    terminology? Let's clarify with an easy example: If a bottle filled
    with water is labeled 'water\', virtually anyone who can read will
    understand the bottle's content. However, if the bottle is labeled
    \'H~2~O\'---even though this is correct---we reach a much smaller
    group of people, for example, the workers of a chemistry lab. Yet,
    the additional benefit is that it shows the composition of the
    content: hydrogen and oxygen. In either case, you will have to
    decide what \'label' is most appropriate for your target group.
-   **What level of abstraction should you choose?** The less abstract a
    model, the more comprehensible, and clear it is for the user. This
    is because a less abstract model is closer to the user's actual use
    and language. On the other hand, models with a high level of
    abstraction are more reusable and they are more easily converted
    into IT systems. We can also prove more accurately that they are
    correct. IT specialists probably manage highly abstract models best.
    Users, on the other hand, might pull their hair out if asked to deal
    with a model like that.

### Practical Tips

**Compromises** have to be made between the level of abstraction,
clarity, and the amount of detail used for a model. It is possible to
develop several model components, differing in degree of formality and
detail, in order to satisfy different target groups. In this way
communication between model builders, customers, users, and developers
can be facilitated much more easily. It is important not to 'overdo' it,
but to adjust the model to its target groups and their uses.

**Analysis** or [**design patterns**](/design_patterns) are example
models that describe common design and modeling methods.

## Process of Analysis

Figure 2.4 shows the process of analysis, which consists of *obtaining*,
*representing*, and *verifying facts*:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_4.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 2.4 Process of Analysis</figcaption>
</figure>

This is the job of the analyst. The process of analysis produces a
specification that comes from the model and other representations. The
analyst works with knowledge carriers, such as customers, users, and
domain experts:

-   Facts are **obtained** by collaboration between analysts and domain
    experts in which knowledge carriers contribute domain knowledge and
    analysts contribute methodological knowledge.
-   Facts are **represented** in diagrams and documents, which are
    usually prepared by the analyst.
-   Facts are **verified** only by knowledge carriers, since they alone
    can decide if the presented facts are correct. Verification is
    absolutely essential. Without it we might have pretty diagrams, but
    the probability is high that the facts represented are faulty. In
    simple terms: development of a model without verification is
    absolutely worthless!

### Practical Tips

It is impossible to develop and verify a usable model without mastering
the technical foundations of a topic. Where do we find these knowledge
carriers who know something about the systems that we want to model? We
have had good experiences with the following groups of people:

-   People who are involved in performing, operating, and controlling
    business processes
-   Users of similar or related IT systems
-   Customers, who are often critical and creative knowledge carriers
-   Business Partners
-   Domain Experts
-   Management
-   External Observers

Several helpful techniques have proven to be useful for the analysis and
understanding of business processes:

-   Observing employees at work
-   Participating in the investigated business processes
-   Taking the role of an outsider (e.g. of a customer)
-   Carrying out surveys
-   Conducting interviews
-   Brainstorming with everyone involved
-   Discussing with domain experts
-   Reviewing existing forms, documentation, specifications, handbooks,
    and work tools
-   Describing the organizational structure and workflow management
    (organization charts,Â etc.)

## Diagrams as Views

Each particular UML diagram corresponds to one **view** of a model of a
system. Depending on the type of diagram used, different aspects are
either emphasized or omitted. All the different views combined result in
a good model of a system. Most of the UML diagrams are *graphs* (as
shown in Figure 2.5), implying that they consist of elements that are
connected through lines:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_5.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 2.5 Diagram as graphs</figcaption>
</figure>

To read diagrams, you have to know what types of elements and lines are
allowed and what they mean. We'll explain this for the diagrams we use
in the following chapters.

Even *computer-aided software engineering* (CASE) tools treat UML
diagrams as views. They use a **database** in which the information
about the model is stored. Each diagram shows---as a view---a part of
that information. In this way, the CASE tool helps to preserve the
consistency of each view. If, for example, the name of a class is
changed in a class diagram, the statechart diagram of that class is
automatically updated:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_6.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 2.6 CASE tool as database</figcaption>
</figure>

The model database is what fundamentally differentiates a CASE tool from
a graphical program (Figure 2.6). Any UML diagram can be generated
easily with paper and pencil or a graphical program. In this case,
however, the various diagrams are nothing more than drawings. Only the
use of a CASE tool with a database, according to UML specifications,
permits consistent collection, management, and modification of model
information.

UML provides its own database model: the UML meta-model, a component of
the UML specifications ("*OMG: Unified Modeling Language:
Infrastructure, Version 2.0, Final Adopted Specification, September
2003*, and *OMG: Unified Modeling Language: Superstructure, Version 2.0,
Revised Final Adopted Specification, October 2004*":
<http://www.omg.org>). All elements found in UML diagrams, as well as
the descriptions of these elements, are contained in the UML meta-model.
It states, for example, that a class can have attributes and methods.
This "data model" of UML as a language, is the foundation of the model
databases of all UML CASE tools. Unfortunately, many CASE tools are
hungry for resources, expensive, poorly developed, cumbersome, and
require extensive training. Despite this, except for very small
projects, their use is worthwhile.

# Models, Views, and Diagrams {#models-views-and-diagrams-1 .title}




## What is a Model?

Models are often built in the context of business and IT systems in
order to better understand existing or future systems. However, a model
never fully corresponds to reality. Modeling always means *emphasizing*
and *omitting*: emphasizing essential details and omitting irrelevant
ones. But what is essential and what is irrelevant? There is no
universal answer to this question. Rather, the answer depends on *what*
the goals of the model are and *who* is viewing or reading it.

> Think about what is emphasized or omitted in the following models:
>
> -   A wind tunnel model of a car
> -   A model of a building scaled at 1:50
> -   A route plan of the subway
> -   A map
> -   An organization chart

The more information a model is supposed to give, the more complex and
difficult it becomes. A map of Europe, for example, that simultaneously
contains political, geological, demographic, and transportation-related
information is hardly legible. The solution to this problem is to convey
the different types of information on individual maps. *Different views*
are formed of the objects under consideration. These views are
interconnected in many ways. Generally, if one view is changed, all
other views have to be adjusted as well. If, for instance, in the
Netherlands new land is reclaimed from the North Sea, all
views---meaning all maps---have to be updated.

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_3.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 2.3 Different views of an object</figcaption>
</figure>

The same is true for the model of a building. If a new wing is added to
an existing building various views are affected, including the floor
plan, the different exterior views, and the 3D-model made from wood.
Figure 2.3 illustrates this in a schematic manner. In *[The Models of
our Case
Study](/uml/basic-principles-and-background/the-models-of-our-case-study)*,
we specifically address the relationships between the models we use in
this book. The different views within each model are described in more
detail in *[Modeling Business Systems](/uml/modeling-business-systems)*,
*[Modeling IT Systems](/uml/modeling-it-systems)* and *[Modeling for
System Integration](/uml/modeling-for-system-integration)*.

## Why do we Need Models?

As a general rule, a model of a system has to perform the following
tasks:

-   **Communication** between all involved parties: In order to build
    the right system, it is essential that all involved parties think
    along the same lines. It is particularly important that everyone
    understands the terminology used, that customers agree upon the same
    requirements, that developers understand these requirements, and
    that the decisions made can still be understood months later.
-   **Visualization** of all facts for customers, experts, and users:
    All accumulated facts relevant to the system need to be presented in
    such a way that everyone concerned can understand them. However,
    according to our real-life experience, we often hit a wall of
    resistance when we want to communicate with diagrams instead of
    text. It is necessary to overcome this resistance. Behind it is
    often a fear of the unknown; and the diagrams might look a bit
    complicated at first. Therefore, this book contains directions on
    how to read each diagram.
-   **Verification** of facts in terms of completeness, consistency, and
    correctness: A (more or less) formal model makes it possible to
    verify the facts obtained for completeness, consistency, and
    correctness. In particular, the clear depiction of
    interrelationships makes it possible to ask specific questions, and
    to answer them. We will list these questions with each diagram.

> Answer the following questions for yourself:
>
> -   When was the last time you felt that you were at cross-purposes
>     when you discussed a system?
> -   When was the last time you felt that you were discussing the same
>     issue over and over again?
> -   When was the last time you wished that the consensus you reached
>     during a discussion had been recorded?

## Purpose and Target Group of a Model

In real life we often observe that the results of cumbersome, tedious,
and expensive modeling simply disappear in a stack of paper on someone's
desk. We might ask why this is so. Two factors greatly influence the
result of modeling: **for whom** do we create the model and **for what
purpose** is it supposed to be used. If we don't discuss and define
these aspects sufficiently, we run the risk of creating models that
don't contain what is important to the user. In other words, if details
are not emphasized and omitted appropriately, the model is rendered
worthless.

To define the purpose and target group the following questions should be
answered:

-   **How much business expertise can we expect?** Can we assume basic
    knowledge of the subject, or do we have to explain the fundamentals
    of the model's events and processes?
-   **What amount of detail does the target group need?** What level of
    complexity does the model permit? If processes and systems are
    subject to constant changes, a highly detailed model might be
    unrealistic. This is because, most of the time, it is not possible
    to maintain those models in a satisfactory manner. A less detailed
    model requires less effort to develop and update, but it is also
    less precise.
-   **How much time does the target group have** to read and interpret
    the model? Prevent your model from disappearing in a stack of paper
    on someone's desk by choosing the appropriate level of detail and
    complexity; otherwise, nobody might have enough time to read it.
-   **What language can be used in the model?** Does the target group
    understand technical business terms? Do they understand IT
    terminology? Let's clarify with an easy example: If a bottle filled
    with water is labeled 'water\', virtually anyone who can read will
    understand the bottle's content. However, if the bottle is labeled
    \'H~2~O\'---even though this is correct---we reach a much smaller
    group of people, for example, the workers of a chemistry lab. Yet,
    the additional benefit is that it shows the composition of the
    content: hydrogen and oxygen. In either case, you will have to
    decide what \'label' is most appropriate for your target group.
-   **What level of abstraction should you choose?** The less abstract a
    model, the more comprehensible, and clear it is for the user. This
    is because a less abstract model is closer to the user's actual use
    and language. On the other hand, models with a high level of
    abstraction are more reusable and they are more easily converted
    into IT systems. We can also prove more accurately that they are
    correct. IT specialists probably manage highly abstract models best.
    Users, on the other hand, might pull their hair out if asked to deal
    with a model like that.

### Practical Tips

**Compromises** have to be made between the level of abstraction,
clarity, and the amount of detail used for a model. It is possible to
develop several model components, differing in degree of formality and
detail, in order to satisfy different target groups. In this way
communication between model builders, customers, users, and developers
can be facilitated much more easily. It is important not to 'overdo' it,
but to adjust the model to its target groups and their uses.

**Analysis** or [**design patterns**](/design_patterns) are example
models that describe common design and modeling methods.

## Process of Analysis

Figure 2.4 shows the process of analysis, which consists of *obtaining*,
*representing*, and *verifying facts*:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_4.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 2.4 Process of Analysis</figcaption>
</figure>

This is the job of the analyst. The process of analysis produces a
specification that comes from the model and other representations. The
analyst works with knowledge carriers, such as customers, users, and
domain experts:

-   Facts are **obtained** by collaboration between analysts and domain
    experts in which knowledge carriers contribute domain knowledge and
    analysts contribute methodological knowledge.
-   Facts are **represented** in diagrams and documents, which are
    usually prepared by the analyst.
-   Facts are **verified** only by knowledge carriers, since they alone
    can decide if the presented facts are correct. Verification is
    absolutely essential. Without it we might have pretty diagrams, but
    the probability is high that the facts represented are faulty. In
    simple terms: development of a model without verification is
    absolutely worthless!

### Practical Tips

It is impossible to develop and verify a usable model without mastering
the technical foundations of a topic. Where do we find these knowledge
carriers who know something about the systems that we want to model? We
have had good experiences with the following groups of people:

-   People who are involved in performing, operating, and controlling
    business processes
-   Users of similar or related IT systems
-   Customers, who are often critical and creative knowledge carriers
-   Business Partners
-   Domain Experts
-   Management
-   External Observers

Several helpful techniques have proven to be useful for the analysis and
understanding of business processes:

-   Observing employees at work
-   Participating in the investigated business processes
-   Taking the role of an outsider (e.g. of a customer)
-   Carrying out surveys
-   Conducting interviews
-   Brainstorming with everyone involved
-   Discussing with domain experts
-   Reviewing existing forms, documentation, specifications, handbooks,
    and work tools
-   Describing the organizational structure and workflow management
    (organization charts,Â etc.)

## Diagrams as Views

Each particular UML diagram corresponds to one **view** of a model of a
system. Depending on the type of diagram used, different aspects are
either emphasized or omitted. All the different views combined result in
a good model of a system. Most of the UML diagrams are *graphs* (as
shown in Figure 2.5), implying that they consist of elements that are
connected through lines:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_5.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 2.5 Diagram as graphs</figcaption>
</figure>

To read diagrams, you have to know what types of elements and lines are
allowed and what they mean. We'll explain this for the diagrams we use
in the following chapters.

Even *computer-aided software engineering* (CASE) tools treat UML
diagrams as views. They use a **database** in which the information
about the model is stored. Each diagram shows---as a view---a part of
that information. In this way, the CASE tool helps to preserve the
consistency of each view. If, for example, the name of a class is
changed in a class diagram, the statechart diagram of that class is
automatically updated:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_6.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 2.6 CASE tool as database</figcaption>
</figure>

The model database is what fundamentally differentiates a CASE tool from
a graphical program (Figure 2.6). Any UML diagram can be generated
easily with paper and pencil or a graphical program. In this case,
however, the various diagrams are nothing more than drawings. Only the
use of a CASE tool with a database, according to UML specifications,
permits consistent collection, management, and modification of model
information.

UML provides its own database model: the UML meta-model, a component of
the UML specifications ("*OMG: Unified Modeling Language:
Infrastructure, Version 2.0, Final Adopted Specification, September
2003*, and *OMG: Unified Modeling Language: Superstructure, Version 2.0,
Revised Final Adopted Specification, October 2004*":
<http://www.omg.org>). All elements found in UML diagrams, as well as
the descriptions of these elements, are contained in the UML meta-model.
It states, for example, that a class can have attributes and methods.
This "data model" of UML as a language, is the foundation of the model
databases of all UML CASE tools. Unfortunately, many CASE tools are
hungry for resources, expensive, poorly developed, cumbersome, and
require extensive training. Despite this, except for very small
projects, their use is worthwhile.
