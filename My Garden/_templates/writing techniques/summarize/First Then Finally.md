> [!NOTE] First Then Finally
> The "First Then Finally" technique helps students summarize events in chronological order. The three words represent the beginning, main action, and conclusion of a story, respectively:
- **First**: What happened first? Include the main character and main event/action.
- **Then**: What key details took place during the event/action?
- **Finally**: What were the results of the event/action?

Example
> **First**, Goldilocks entered the bears' home while they were gone. **Then**, she ate their food, sat in their chairs, and slept in their beds. **Finally**, she woke up to find the bears watching her, so she jumped up and ran away.
