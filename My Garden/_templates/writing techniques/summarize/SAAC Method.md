> [!NOTE] SAAC Method
> The SAAC method is another useful technique for summarizing any kind of text (such as a story, an article, or a speech). SAAC is an acronym for "State, Assign, Action, Complete." Each word in the acronym refers to a specific element that should be included in the summary.

- **State**: the name of the article, book, or story
- **Assign**: the name of the author
- **Action**: what the author is doing (example: tells, explains)
- **Complete**: complete the sentence or summary with keywords and important details

Example
> "*The Boy Who Cried Wolf*,"(**State**) by *Aesop* (a Greek storyteller, **Assign**), *tells*(**action**) *what happens when a shepherd boy repeatedly lies to the villagers about seeing a wolf.*(**Complete**) After a while, they ignore his false cries. Then, when a wolf really does attack, they don’t come to help him.
