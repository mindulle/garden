# The Life of an Object {#the-life-of-an-object .title}




Persons, objects, or concepts from the real world, which we model as
objects in the IT system, have "lives". Actually, they have two lives;
the original in the real world has a life, and our image, the object,
has a life as well. Though these two lives are related, they do not
necessarily follow the same course. Usually, a life starts at birth,
creation, or generation and ends with death, deletion, or destruction.
In between, life follows a more or less ordered course, as illustrated
in Figure 4.43:

<figure class="image">

<figcaption>Figure 4.43 The life of a plane</figcaption>
</figure>

To illustrate what we mentioned before we would like to take a closer
look at the life of a plane. The plane that we would like to look at is
an Airbus A330-223 of Swiss International Airlines with the registration
number HB-IQI.

-   The birth of the Airbus A330-223 (of the *original*) occurs,
    depending on the perspective, at the start of construction or at the
    first flight.
-   The birth of the *object* of the Airbus A330-223 in the IT system
    occurs when information about the plane is recorded for the first
    time. This can be at the point of purchase, since the plane could be
    recorded in the IT system for planning purposes, or when the plane
    is delivered. The initiator for the birth of an object in the IT
    system is always a mutation event.

Because commercial airplanes are often sold long before construction
begins, it is possible that the birth of the object occurs before the
(physical) birth of the plane.

-   The death of the *original* has to do with physical destruction. In
    the case of our Airbus A330-233 death occurs at withdrawal or
    possibly in a plane crash.
-   The death of the *object* occurs, when the object is deleted from
    the IT system of Swiss Airline. The initiator for the death of an
    object in the IT system is always a mutation event.

Because commercial airplanes are often sold on after a certain period of
time, it is possible that the (logical) death of an object in the IT
system occurs before the (physical) death of the original.

Between birth and death the object is alive in the IT system, that is,
it will be read and changed. It will be read as the result of a query
event; it will be changed as the result of a mutation event (see *[Query
Events and Mutation
Events](/uml/modeling-it-systems/external-view/query-events-and-mutation-events)*).

As long as reading and modifying objects are not subject to any
restrictions, this is not especially interesting. It can be described in
a simple statechart diagram (see Figure 4.44). However, as soon as rules
for modification have to be observed, it becomes important to document
these rules somewhere. Here, we are talking about dynamic business rules
(see *[Static and Dynamic Business
Rules](/uml/modeling-it-systems/structural-view/static-and-dynamic-business-rules)*).
Dynamic business rules are rules that only apply at a certain point in
time, namely when a query event or a mutation event occurs. The behavior
of objects is largely determined by such dynamic business rules.

Examples of dynamic business rules are:

-   A plane cannot be assigned a flight during the time it is in
    maintenance.
-   A plane cannot be withdrawn as long as it is still scheduled for
    flights.

If we take a closer look at these business rules, we recognize that they
refer to certain events on the one hand, and to states of the object on
the other hand:

-   The mutation event *assigning a flight to a plane* is not permitted
    in the state in maintenance of the object plane.
-   The mutation event *withdrawing plane* is not permitted in the state
    *flights scheduled* of the object plane.
-   The mutation event *starting plane* is not permitted in the state in
    transit of the object plane.

In other words: For certain events it should be possible to determine if
an event is permitted in the current state of the object, and how the
object will react to the event.

> Consider the dynamic business rules that could apply to the object
> plane ticket in a passenger services system.

In the behavioral view, one statechart diagram per class is used to
document which dynamic business rules have to be followed, and which
events are allowed in which states of objects. In the simplest case, all
events are allowed. Figure 4.44 shows a simple statechart diagram for
the class frequent flyer card:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_144.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 4.44 Simple statechart diagram for the frequent flyer
card</figcaption>
</figure>

A new object is created by the event «M» New Card (1). An object is
deleted by the event «M» Delete Card (2). In between the object is in
the state Normal (3), in which "*all other events*" (4) are allowed (in
a real statechart diagram the events that are actually allowed have to
be listed by name instead of the event "all other events").

If, however, we add business rules, the statechart diagram becomes more
complex. We would like to amend our statechart diagram with the
following rules:

-   It has to be possible to suspend and reinstate a frequent flyer
    card.
-   It is not possible to add any miles to a suspended frequent flyer
    card.

If we amend our statechart diagram with the mentioned dynamic business
rules, the diagram depicted in Figure 4.45 is created:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_145.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 4.45 More complex statechart diagram for the frequent
flyer card</figcaption>
</figure>

A statechart diagram, such as the one of the frequent flyer card in
Figure 4.45, shows on which paths or within which boundaries the life of
a frequent flyer card object can proceed. In the diagram, possible and
impossible chains of events can be recognized. A possible flow is, for
instance, «M» new card, «M» add miles, «M» add miles, «M» add miles, «M»
suspend card, «M» delete card.

An example of a sequence that is not permitted is: «M» new card, «M» add
miles, «M» add miles, «M» suspend card, «M» add miles, «M» delete card.
The second to last event, «M» add miles, is not accepted. If the card
were unsuspended, miles could be added to it again.

> Consider whether or not the following chains of events are permitted
> according to the statechart diagram of the class frequent flyer card
> in Figure 4.45:
>
> -   «M» add miles, «M» add miles, «M» add miles, «M» delete card, «M»
>     delete card.
> -   «M» new card, «M» add miles, «M» suspend card, «M» unsuspend card,
>     «M» add miles, «M» delete card.
> -   «M» new card, «M» add miles, «M» suspend card, «M» suspend card,
>     «M» delete card.

Generally, the life of an object follows such a predetermined course,
meaning that the object has to follow certain rules. Thus, the
behavioral view is especially important, because it is the job of the IT
system to ensure that these rules are followed. It is important that
rules are documented in a correct and complete manner, to avoid
misunderstandings on both the user side and the developer side. In a
completed IT system, it should not be possible for a user to delete or
modify objects when it is not permitted by business rules.

In the Hanseatic Merchant's trading office, an object corresponds to a
book, for instance, the order book, and the clerk who is responsible for
that book. The statechart diagram of the object contains the rules that
the clerk has to follow when he handles the book. It is his instruction
manual. It states, for example, that an order that has already been
delivered, but that is not yet paid for, cannot be canceled. If you
could sit next to the clerk for a while and watch him do his work, you
would be able to see everything that can happen with an order in the
order book. It can, for example, be recorded, modified, delivered,
canceled, or paid for. The statechart diagram of the behavioral view
contains the result of this object observation.

# The Life of an Object {#the-life-of-an-object-1 .title}




Persons, objects, or concepts from the real world, which we model as
objects in the IT system, have "lives". Actually, they have two lives;
the original in the real world has a life, and our image, the object,
has a life as well. Though these two lives are related, they do not
necessarily follow the same course. Usually, a life starts at birth,
creation, or generation and ends with death, deletion, or destruction.
In between, life follows a more or less ordered course, as illustrated
in Figure 4.43:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_143.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 4.43 The life of a plane</figcaption>
</figure>

To illustrate what we mentioned before we would like to take a closer
look at the life of a plane. The plane that we would like to look at is
an Airbus A330-223 of Swiss International Airlines with the registration
number HB-IQI.

-   The birth of the Airbus A330-223 (of the *original*) occurs,
    depending on the perspective, at the start of construction or at the
    first flight.
-   The birth of the *object* of the Airbus A330-223 in the IT system
    occurs when information about the plane is recorded for the first
    time. This can be at the point of purchase, since the plane could be
    recorded in the IT system for planning purposes, or when the plane
    is delivered. The initiator for the birth of an object in the IT
    system is always a mutation event.

Because commercial airplanes are often sold long before construction
begins, it is possible that the birth of the object occurs before the
(physical) birth of the plane.

-   The death of the *original* has to do with physical destruction. In
    the case of our Airbus A330-233 death occurs at withdrawal or
    possibly in a plane crash.
-   The death of the *object* occurs, when the object is deleted from
    the IT system of Swiss Airline. The initiator for the death of an
    object in the IT system is always a mutation event.

Because commercial airplanes are often sold on after a certain period of
time, it is possible that the (logical) death of an object in the IT
system occurs before the (physical) death of the original.

Between birth and death the object is alive in the IT system, that is,
it will be read and changed. It will be read as the result of a query
event; it will be changed as the result of a mutation event (see *[Query
Events and Mutation
Events](/uml/modeling-it-systems/external-view/query-events-and-mutation-events)*).

As long as reading and modifying objects are not subject to any
restrictions, this is not especially interesting. It can be described in
a simple statechart diagram (see Figure 4.44). However, as soon as rules
for modification have to be observed, it becomes important to document
these rules somewhere. Here, we are talking about dynamic business rules
(see *[Static and Dynamic Business
Rules](/uml/modeling-it-systems/structural-view/static-and-dynamic-business-rules)*).
Dynamic business rules are rules that only apply at a certain point in
time, namely when a query event or a mutation event occurs. The behavior
of objects is largely determined by such dynamic business rules.

Examples of dynamic business rules are:

-   A plane cannot be assigned a flight during the time it is in
    maintenance.
-   A plane cannot be withdrawn as long as it is still scheduled for
    flights.

If we take a closer look at these business rules, we recognize that they
refer to certain events on the one hand, and to states of the object on
the other hand:

-   The mutation event *assigning a flight to a plane* is not permitted
    in the state in maintenance of the object plane.
-   The mutation event *withdrawing plane* is not permitted in the state
    *flights scheduled* of the object plane.
-   The mutation event *starting plane* is not permitted in the state in
    transit of the object plane.

In other words: For certain events it should be possible to determine if
an event is permitted in the current state of the object, and how the
object will react to the event.

> Consider the dynamic business rules that could apply to the object
> plane ticket in a passenger services system.

In the behavioral view, one statechart diagram per class is used to
document which dynamic business rules have to be followed, and which
events are allowed in which states of objects. In the simplest case, all
events are allowed. Figure 4.44 shows a simple statechart diagram for
the class frequent flyer card:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_144.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 4.44 Simple statechart diagram for the frequent flyer
card</figcaption>
</figure>

A new object is created by the event «M» New Card (1). An object is
deleted by the event «M» Delete Card (2). In between the object is in
the state Normal (3), in which "*all other events*" (4) are allowed (in
a real statechart diagram the events that are actually allowed have to
be listed by name instead of the event "all other events").

If, however, we add business rules, the statechart diagram becomes more
complex. We would like to amend our statechart diagram with the
following rules:

-   It has to be possible to suspend and reinstate a frequent flyer
    card.
-   It is not possible to add any miles to a suspended frequent flyer
    card.

If we amend our statechart diagram with the mentioned dynamic business
rules, the diagram depicted in Figure 4.45 is created:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_145.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 4.45 More complex statechart diagram for the frequent
flyer card</figcaption>
</figure>

A statechart diagram, such as the one of the frequent flyer card in
Figure 4.45, shows on which paths or within which boundaries the life of
a frequent flyer card object can proceed. In the diagram, possible and
impossible chains of events can be recognized. A possible flow is, for
instance, «M» new card, «M» add miles, «M» add miles, «M» add miles, «M»
suspend card, «M» delete card.

An example of a sequence that is not permitted is: «M» new card, «M» add
miles, «M» add miles, «M» suspend card, «M» add miles, «M» delete card.
The second to last event, «M» add miles, is not accepted. If the card
were unsuspended, miles could be added to it again.

> Consider whether or not the following chains of events are permitted
> according to the statechart diagram of the class frequent flyer card
> in Figure 4.45:
>
> -   «M» add miles, «M» add miles, «M» add miles, «M» delete card, «M»
>     delete card.
> -   «M» new card, «M» add miles, «M» suspend card, «M» unsuspend card,
>     «M» add miles, «M» delete card.
> -   «M» new card, «M» add miles, «M» suspend card, «M» suspend card,
>     «M» delete card.

Generally, the life of an object follows such a predetermined course,
meaning that the object has to follow certain rules. Thus, the
behavioral view is especially important, because it is the job of the IT
system to ensure that these rules are followed. It is important that
rules are documented in a correct and complete manner, to avoid
misunderstandings on both the user side and the developer side. In a
completed IT system, it should not be possible for a user to delete or
modify objects when it is not permitted by business rules.

In the Hanseatic Merchant's trading office, an object corresponds to a
book, for instance, the order book, and the clerk who is responsible for
that book. The statechart diagram of the object contains the rules that
the clerk has to follow when he handles the book. It is his instruction
manual. It states, for example, that an order that has already been
delivered, but that is not yet paid for, cannot be canceled. If you
could sit next to the clerk for a while and watch him do his work, you
would be able to see everything that can happen with an order in the
order book. It can, for example, be recorded, modified, delivered,
