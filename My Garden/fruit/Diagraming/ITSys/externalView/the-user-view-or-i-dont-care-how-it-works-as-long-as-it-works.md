# The User View or \"I don\'t care how it works, as long as it works.\" {#the-user-view-or-i-dont-care-how-it-works-as-long-as-it-works. .title}




If today someone uses a modern piece of equipment, for example a video
recorder, an ATM, or a cell phone, he or she is rarely interested in how
that piece of equipment looks from the inside. The average user does not
care which electronic parts a machine consists of, or what software it
includes. On the other hand, what the machine can be used for, or what
functionalities it provides, is important to the user. For instance, the
buyer of a cell phone wants to know if the device has WAP capability or
how many addresses it can store. Usually, the potential buyer of a cell
phone is interested in how the device can be used; he or she is not
interested in how the device is built internally, as long as it has the
desired functionalities.

This type of view of a system is called a *black-box view*, meaning the
system or device is pictured as a black box---you cannot look inside.
You don't know how it works; you only know that it does work. Ideally,
this is the view a user should have of an IT system. He or she uses the
IT system to complete his or her work, just like a coffee maker or
copier. He or she knows what can be done with the system, and usually
also knows how to do it.

The external view is an essential part of the IT system model. Here, it
is determined what future users expect from the IT system. The
functionality that is defined in this view should ultimately be used to
verify if the IT system fulfils the requirements.

The external view consists of the elements use case diagrams, use case
sequence diagrams, and interface prototypes. At first sight, these
elements appear strange. Some analysts may be tempted to allege that it
is sufficient to record user requirements in the form of prose. But
practical experience shows again and again that this is not true. Prose
can be inconsistent, imprecise, and incomplete, without it becoming
obvious to the future user when he or she reads it. The IT system is
developed accordingly and the programmer interprets the prose as a third
party, from his or her own viewpoint, and implements the system
accordingly. The UML-defined diagrams that we describe and explain in
this chapter are meant to help avoid misunderstandings and
misinterpretations. The diagrams are tools to describe the requirements
for an IT system.

</figure>

An essential element of a system is its user interface. The user
interface of an ATM, for example, consists of a small monitor, the keys,
and the openings for cards, bills, and receipts, as well as the beep.

The user interface is the only access point that a user has to a system.
If, for instance, the recording button of a video recorder is missing,
it is impossible to record anything, even if the video recorder is
equipped for this function internally.

The user interface represents a type of view of the functionality of the
device. What is missing in this view is inaccessible.

However, the user interface gives a static view of the system. This view
does not show how the system is supposed to be used, and which operating
elements have to be used in which order to complete a certain task.

Because of this, user interfaces require instruction manuals. This means
that we need a description that identifies the actions that are possible
and what sequence has to be followed for the system to be used in a
meaningful manner. In UML, these courses of actions are called use
cases. *Usecases* are instruction manuals for the user interface. Only
what is defined in an instruction manual is a meaningful course of
action.

The following example is a meaningful course of action (flow) for the
use of a phone: picking up receiver, waiting for the dial tone, typing a
valid phone number, waiting for someone to answer the phone, talking,
and hanging up.

Flows that are not defined in the instruction manual are not regarded as
meaningful and are not supported by the system. In poorly developed
systems, it can happen that flows that are not defined have unexpected
consequences or even crash the system.

Sometimes, modern IT systems can solve ad hoc problems, especially
queries. Because of their nature, ad hoc use cases are not included in
normal descriptions. Other solutions have to be found for them, for
example, the specification of an environment or of a specific system
that supports ad hoc queries. Instead of a description, ad hoc use cases
receive a reference to a reporting tool or query language.

For users, a system essentially consists of a user interface and use
cases, even though these generally only represent the tip of the
iceberg. Everything beyond that is of no interest for users. Or did you
ever ponder what type of system is behind the keys of your cell phone?

</figure>

The best approach to model the use cases of an IT system is precisely to
imagine a user who sits in front of the keyboard and works with the IT
system (see Figure 4.4). The user becomes the actor, and the use case is
nothing more than an abstract description of the user's activity.

An actor:

-   Interacts directly with a system
-   Is always located outside the system with which he or she interacts

For the IT system, this means that the actor is always the one who
directly operates the IT system.

Even in higher-ranking business systems (see *[Modeling Business
Systems](/uml/modeling-business-systems)*) actors are located on the
outside. They can be, for example, customers or partners.

The worker who operates the IT system, on the other hand, is part of the
business system. Because of this, he or she cannot be an actor of the
business system:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_88.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 4.5 Actors of the business system and IT
system</figcaption>
</figure>

This leads to the situation shown in Figure 4.5:

-   A *passenger* is actor of the business system, and generally deals
    with a check-in employee. However, he or she can also be a firsthand
    actor of the IT system, for example, during automated check-in at a
    machine.
-   A *check-in employee* is part of the business system. Because of
    this he or she is not an actor of the business system. On the other
    hand, as user he or she is an actor of the IT system.
-   A *check-in representative*, who performs check-in in place of
    another person, is only an actor of the business system, because he
    or she cannot perform automated check-in and therefore never has
    direct contact with the IT system.

In summary, we can say that actors and use cases are very well suited to
communicate with users or domain experts about the functionality of IT
systems that is visible from the outside.

In our Hanseatic merchant's trading office, the separation between
business system and IT system is somewhat difficult. However, you can
consider that the clerk's office with the clerks and secretary
Hildebrand make up the functionality of an information system (without
IT). A use case then, would correspond with a work process of secretary
Hildebrand, such as updating payment receipts or summarizing the costs
and revenues of last month. Here, the actor is the owner, Mr. Hafenstein
(see Figure 4.6):
