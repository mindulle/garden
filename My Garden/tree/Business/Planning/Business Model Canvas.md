## Business Model Canvas
> The **Business Model Canvas** is a strategic management and visual representation tool that allows you to describe, design, challenge, and pivot your existing business model.

\- by *[UX Design Roadmap from roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/ux-design)*

The canvas is divided into nine building blocks, which represent the essential elements of a business model:
- [[seed/UX/Channels (CH)|Channels (CH)]], [[seed/UX/Revenue Streams (RS)|Revenue Streams (RS)]]
- [[seed/UX/Value Propositions (VP)|Value Propositions (VP)]], [[seed/UX/Cost Structure (CS)|Cost Structure (CS)]]
- [[seed/UX/Key Resources (KR)|Key Resources (KR)]], [[seed/UX/Key Activities (KA)|Key Activities (KA)]], [[seed/UX/Key Partnerships (KP)|Key Partnerships (KP)]]
- [[seed/UX/Customer Segments (CS)|Customer Segments (CS)]], [[seed/UX/Customer Relationships (CR)|Customer Relationships (CR)]]

When designing or analyzing an existing business model, the Business Model Canvas enables you to visually map out all these critical components and understand how they are interconnected.
