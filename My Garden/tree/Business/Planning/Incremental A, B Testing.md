## Incremental A/B Testing
> Incremental A/B testing is the process of testing small design, content, or functionality changes in your user experience (UX) design to evaluate their impact on your conversion goals.

This approach has several benefits:
- Reduced Risk
- Easier Implementation

### How to Conduct Incremental A/B Testing
1. **Identify Your Goal**
2. **Define a Hypothesis**
3. **Design and Implement Changes**
4. **Set up A/B Testing**
	- Use a reliable A/B testing tool to set up your testing environment. 
	- Ensure that you have a control version (without changes) 
	- and a treatment version (with changes) to compare within the test.
5. **Analyze and Interpret Results**
6. **Iterate and Improve**
