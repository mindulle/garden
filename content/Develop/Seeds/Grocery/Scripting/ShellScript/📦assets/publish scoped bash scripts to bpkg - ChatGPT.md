1.  Create a new account on npm, or log in to your existing account.
    
2.  Set up two-factor authentication for your account. This is required to publish scoped packages on npm.
    
3.  Create a new package using the `bpkg create` command and specify a scope for your package. For example: `bpkg create @myorg/mypackage`. This will create a new package in the current directory and initialize a `package.json` file.
    
4.  Add your bash scripts to the package. You can add them to the `bin` field in the `package.json` file or create a `bin` directory in your package and add them there.
    
5.  Publish your package to npm using the `bpkg publish` command. This will publish your package to npm and make it available for installation via bpkg.
    
6.  To install your scoped package, you will need to provide the full package name, including the scope. For example: `bpkg install @myorg/mypackage`.
