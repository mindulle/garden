## Bit mask
?
> InÂ [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), aÂ **mask**Â orÂ **bitmask**Â is data that is used forÂ [bitwise operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation "Bitwise operation"), particularly in aÂ [bit field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field "Bit field"). Using a mask, **multiple bits** in aÂ [byte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte "Byte"),Â [nibble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibble "Nibble"),Â [word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture) "Word (computer architecture)"), etc. can be set either on or off, or inverted from ==**on to off (or vice versa)**== in a single bitwise operation. An additional use of masking involvesÂ **[predication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predication_(computer_architecture) "Predication (computer architecture)")Â inÂ [vector processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_processing "Vector processing")**, where the bitmask is used to select which element operations in the vector are to be executed (mask bit is enabled) and which are not (mask bit is clear). **_[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_(computing))_**

## Drop-in replacement
?
> **Drop-in replacement**Â is a term used inÂ [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science")Â and other fields. It refers to the ability to replace oneÂ [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware "Computer hardware")Â (orÂ [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software "Software")) component with another one without any other code or configuration changes being required and resulting in no negative impacts. __*[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop-in_replacement)*__.
