Inclusive Components is a library of accessible and inclusive UI components that you can use on your website or web application. To use the components via a CDN (Content Delivery Network), you can include the following link in the `head` of your HTML document:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.inclusive-components.design/latest/inclusive-components.min.css" />
```

This will include the necessary CSS styles for the components in your document.

To use a specific component, you can include the HTML for that component in your document. For example, to use the `inclusive-button` component, you can include the following HTML:

```html
<button class="inclusive-button">Button</button>
```

You can find more information about the available components and how to use them in the [Inclusive Components documentation](https://inclusive-components.design/).
