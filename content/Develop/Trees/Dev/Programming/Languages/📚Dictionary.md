## Language Server Protocol
> TheÂ **Language Server Protocol**Â (**LSP**) is an open,Â [JSON-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC "JSON-RPC")-basedÂ [protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol")Â for use betweenÂ [source code editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_editor "Source code editor")Â orÂ [integrated development environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment "Integrated development environment")Â (IDEs) andÂ [servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing) "Server (computing)")Â that provideÂ [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language")-specific features likeÂ [code completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocomplete "Autocomplete"),Â [syntax highlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting "Syntax highlighting")Â and marking of warnings and errors, as well asÂ [refactoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring "Code refactoring")Â routines. The goal of the protocol is to allow programming language support to be implemented and distributed independently of any given editor or IDE. **_[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol)_**
