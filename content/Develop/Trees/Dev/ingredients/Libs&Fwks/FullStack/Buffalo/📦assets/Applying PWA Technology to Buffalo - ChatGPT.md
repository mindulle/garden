Yes, it is possible to apply progressive web app (PWA) technology to an application built with Buffalo. Buffalo is a web development framework for the Go programming language that makes it easy to build web applications quickly. It includes built-in support for many of the features that are commonly needed in web applications, such as routing, rendering templates, and working with databases.

To apply PWA technology to a Buffalo application, you will need to create a manifest file and include it in the HTML of your application. The manifest file describes the properties of your PWA, such as its name, its start URL, and its icons. You will also need to serve your application over HTTPS, as PWAs must be served over a secure connection.

Additionally, you can use service workers to add offline support to your PWA. Service workers are JavaScript files that run in the background of your application and can intercept network requests, allowing you to cache assets and create a seamless offline experience for your users.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
