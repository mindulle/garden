## Architecture
> **Software architecture**Â is the fundamental structure of aÂ [software system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_system "Software system")Â and the discipline of creating such structures and systems. Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations. **_[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture)_**

> Even though an architectural pattern conveys an image of a system, it is not an architecture. An architectural pattern is a concept that solves and delineates some essential cohesive elements of a software architecture. Countless different architectures may implement the same pattern and share the related characteristics. Patterns are often defined as "strictly described and commonly available". **_[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern)_**
