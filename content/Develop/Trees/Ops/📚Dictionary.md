## Software release life cycle
> TheÂ **software release life cycle**Â is the process of developing, testing, and distributing a software product. It typically consists of several stages, such as pre-alpha, alpha, beta, and release candidate, before the final version, or "gold," is released to the public. **_[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle)_**
