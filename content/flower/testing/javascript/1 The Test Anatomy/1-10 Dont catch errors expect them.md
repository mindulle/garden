## 1.10 Don’t catch errors, expect them

:white_check_mark: **Do:** When trying to assert that some input triggers an error, it might look right to use try-catch-finally and asserts that the catch clause was entered. The result is an awkward and verbose test case (example below) that hides the simple test intent and the result expectations

A more elegant alternative is the using the one-line dedicated Chai assertion: expect(method).to.throw (or in Jest: expect(method).toThrow()). It’s absolutely mandatory to also ensure the exception contains a property that tells the error type, otherwise given just a generic error the application won’t be able to do much rather than show a disappointing message to the user
<br/>

❌ **Otherwise:** It will be challenging to infer from the test reports (e.g. CI reports) what went wrong

### :thumbsdown: Anti-pattern Example: A long test case that tries to assert the existence of error with try-catch

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/🔧%20Example%20using%20Mocha-blue.svg "Examples with Mocha")

```javascript
it("When no product name, it throws error 400", async () => {
  let errorWeExceptFor = null;
  try {
    const result = await addNewProduct({});
  } catch (error) {
    expect(error.code).to.equal("InvalidInput");
    errorWeExceptFor = error;
  }
  expect(errorWeExceptFor).not.to.be.null;
  //if this assertion fails, the tests results/reports will only show
  //that some value is null, there won't be a word about a missing Exception
});
```

<br/>

### :clap: Doing It Right Example: A human-readable expectation that could be understood easily, maybe even by QA or technical PM

```javascript
it("When no product name, it throws error 400", async () => {
  await expect(addNewProduct({}))
    .to.eventually.throw(AppError)
    .with.property("code", "InvalidInput");
});
```
