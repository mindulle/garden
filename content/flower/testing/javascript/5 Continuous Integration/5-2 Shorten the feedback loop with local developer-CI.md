## ⚪ ️ 5.2 Shorten the feedback loop with local developer-CI

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Using a CI with shiny quality inspections like testing, linting, vulnerabilities check, etc? Help developers run this pipeline also locally to solicit instant feedback and shorten the [feedback loop](https://www.gocd.org/2016/03/15/are-you-ready-for-continuous-delivery-part-2-feedback-loops/). Why? an efficient testing process constitutes many and iterative loops: (1) try-outs -> (2) feedback -> (3) refactor. The faster the feedback is, the more improvement iterations a developer can perform per-module and perfect the results. On the flip, when the feedback is late to come fewer improvement iterations could be packed into a single day, the team might already move forward to another topic/task/module and might not be up for refining that module.

Practically, some CI vendors (Example: [CircleCI local CLI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/)) allow running the pipeline locally. Some commercial tools like [wallaby provide highly-valuable & testing insights](https://wallabyjs.com/) as a developer prototype (no affiliation). Alternatively, you may just add npm script to package.json that runs all the quality commands (e.g. test, lint, vulnerabilities) — use tools like [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) for parallelization and non-zero exit code if one of the tools failed. Now the developer should just invoke one command — e.g. ‘npm run quality’ — to get instant feedback. Consider also aborting a commit if the quality check failed using a githook ([husky can help](https://github.com/typicode/husky))

❌ **Otherwise:** When the quality results arrive the day after the code, testing doesn’t become a fluent part of development rather an after the fact formal artifact

### :clap: Doing It Right Example: npm scripts that perform code quality inspection, all are run in parallel on demand or when a developer is trying to push new code

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "inspect:sanity-testing": "mocha **/**--test.js --grep \"sanity\"",
    "inspect:lint": "eslint .",
    "inspect:vulnerabilities": "npm audit",
    "inspect:license": "license-checker --failOn GPLv2",
    "inspect:complexity": "plato .",
    "inspect:all": "concurrently -c \"bgBlue.bold,bgMagenta.bold,yellow\" \"npm:inspect:quick-testing\" \"npm:inspect:lint\" \"npm:inspect:vulnerabilities\" \"npm:inspect:license\""
  },
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "precommit": "npm run inspect:all",
      "prepush": "npm run inspect:all"
    }
  }
}
```
