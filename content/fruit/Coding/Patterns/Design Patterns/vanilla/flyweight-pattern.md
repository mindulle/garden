# Flyweight Pattern

The flyweight pattern is a useful way to conserve memory when we're creating a large number of similar objects.

In our application, we want users to be able to add books. All books have a `title`, an `author`, and an `isbn` number! However, a library usually doesn't have just one copy of a book: it usually has multiple copies of the same book.

It wouldn't be very useful to create a new book instance each time if there are multiple copies of the exact same book. Instead, we want to create multiple instances of the `Book` constructor, that represent a single book.

```js
class Book {
  constructor(title, author, isbn) {
    this.title = title;
    this.author = author;
    this.isbn = isbn;
  }
}
```

Let's create the functionality to add new books to the list. If a book has the same ISBN number, thus is the exact same book type, we don't want to create an entirely new `Book` instance. Instead, we should first check whether this book already exists.

```js
const books = new Map();

const createBook = (title, author, isbn) => {
  const existingBook = books.has(isbn);

  if (existingBook) {
    return books.get(isbn);
  }
};
```

If it doesn't contain the book's ISBN number yet, we'll create a new book and add its ISBN number to the `isbnNumbers` set.

```js
const createBook = (title, author, isbn) => {
  const existingBook = books.has(isbn);

  if (existingBook) {
    return books.get(isbn);
  }

  const book = new Book(title, author, isbn);
  books.set(isbn, book);

  return book;
};
```

The `createBook` function helps us create new instances of one type of book. However, a library usually contains multiple copies of the same book! Let's create an `addBook` function, which allows us to add multiple copies of the same book. It should invoke the `createBook` function, which returns either a newly created `Book` instance, or returns the already existing instance.

In order to keep track of the total amount of copies, let's create a
`bookList` array that contains the total amount of books in the library.

```js
const bookList = [];

const addBook = (title, author, isbn, availability, sales) => {
  const book = {
    ...createBook(title, author, isbn),
    sales,
    availability,
    isbn,
  };

  bookList.push(book);
  return book;
};
```

Perfect! Instead of creating a new `Book` instance each time we add a copy, we can effectively use the already existing `Book` instance for that particular copy. Let's create 5 copies of 3 books: Harry Potter, To Kill a Mockingbird, and The Great Gatsby.

```js
addBook("Harry Potter", "JK Rowling", "AB123", false, 100);
addBook("Harry Potter", "JK Rowling", "AB123", true, 50);
addBook("To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harper Lee", "CD345", true, 10);
addBook("To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harper Lee", "CD345", false, 20);
addBook("The Great Gatsby", "F. Scott Fitzgerald", "EF567", false, 20);
```

Although there are 5 copies, we only have 3 `Book` instances!

The flyweight pattern is useful when you're creating a huge number of objects, which could potentially drain all available RAM. It allows us to minimize the amount of consumed memory.

In JavaScript, we can easily solve this problem through [prototypal inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain). Nowadays, hardware has GBs of RAM, which makes the flyweight pattern less important.
