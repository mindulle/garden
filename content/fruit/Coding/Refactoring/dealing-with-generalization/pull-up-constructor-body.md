# Pull Up Constructor Body
### Problem

Your subclasses have constructors with code that's mostly identical.

```ts
class Manager extends Employee {
  constructor(name: string, id: string, grade: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.id = id;
    this.grade = grade;
  }
  // ...
}
```

### Solution

Create a superclass constructor and move the code thatâ€™s the same in the subclasses to it. Call the superclass constructor in the subclass constructors.

```ts
class Manager extends Employee {
  constructor(name: string, id: string, grade: number) {
    super(name, id);
    this.grade = grade;
  }
  // ...
}
```

### Why Refactor

How is this refactoring technique different from [Pull Up
Method](/pull-up-method)?

1.  In Java, subclasses can't inherit a constructor, so you can't simply
    apply [Pull Up Method](/pull-up-method) to the subclass constructor
    and delete it after removing all the constructor code to the
    superclass. In addition to creating a constructor in the superclass
    it's necessary to have constructors in the subclasses with simple
    delegation to the superclass constructor.

2.  In C++ and Java (if you didn't explicitly call the superclass
    constructor) the superclass constructor is automatically called
    prior to the subclass constructor, which makes it necessary to move
    the common code only from the beginning of the subclass constructors
    (since you won't be able to call the superclass constructor from an
    arbitrary place in a subclass constructor).

3.  In most programming languages, a subclass constructor can have its
    own list of parameters different from the parameters of the
    superclass. Therefore you should create a superclass constructor
    only with the parameters that it truly needs.

### How to Refactor

1.  Create a constructor in a superclass.

2.  Extract the common code from the beginning of the constructor of
    each subclass to the superclass constructor. Before doing so, try to
    move as much common code as possible to the beginning of the
    constructor.

3.  Place the call for the superclass constructor in the first line in
    the subclass constructors.
