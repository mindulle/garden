# Moving Features between Objects

Even if you have distributed functionality among different classes in a less-than-perfect way, there's still hope.

These refactoring techniques show how to safely move functionality between classes, create new classes, and hide implementation details from public access.

- **Problem:** A method is used more in another class than in its own class.

- **Solution:** Create a new method in the class that uses the method the most, then move code from the old method to there. Turn the code of the original method into a reference to the new method in the other class or else remove it entirely.

- **Problem:** A field is used more in another class than in its own class.

- **Solution:** Create a field in a new class and redirect all users of the old field to it.

- **Problem:** When one class does the work of two, awkwardness results.

- **Solution:** Instead, create a new class and place the fields and methods responsible for the relevant functionality in it.

- **Problem:** A class does almost nothing and isn't responsible for anything, and no additional responsibilities are planned for it.

- **Solution:** Move all features from the class to another one.

- **Problem:** The client gets object B from a field or method of object –ê. Then the client calls a method of object B.

- **Solution:** Create a new method in class A that delegates the call to object B. Now the client doesn't know about, or depend on, class B.

- **Problem:** A class has too many methods that simply delegate to other objects.

- **Solution:** Delete these methods and force the client to call the end methods directly.

- **Problem:** A utility class doesn't contain the method that you need and you can't add the method to the class.

- **Solution:** Add the method to a client class and pass an object of the utility class to it as an argument.

[[fruit/Coding/Refactoring/techniques/moving-features-between-objects/introduce-local-extension|Introduce Local Extension]]

- **Problem:** A utility class doesn't contain some methods that you need. But you can't add these methods to the class.

- **Solution:** Create a new class containing the methods and make it either the child or wrapper of the utility class.
