## ⚪ ️ 2.6 Check your readiness for Node-related chaos

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Weirdly, most software testings are about logic & data only, but some of the worst things that happen (and are really hard to mitigate) are infrastructural issues. For example, did you ever test what happens when your process memory is overloaded, or when the server/process dies, or does your monitoring system realizes when the API becomes 50% slower?. To test and mitigate these type of bad things — [Chaos engineering](https://principlesofchaos.org/) was born by Netflix. It aims to provide awareness, frameworks and tools for testing our app resiliency for chaotic issues. For example, one of its famous tools, [the chaos monkey](https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey), randomly kills servers to ensure that our service can still serve users and not relying on a single server (there is also a Kubernetes version, [kube-monkey](https://github.com/asobti/kube-monkey), that kills pods). All these tools work on the hosting/platform level, but what if you wish to test and generate pure Node chaos like check how your Node process copes with uncaught errors, unhandled promise rejection, v8 memory overloaded with the max allowed of 1.7GB or whether your UX remains satisfactory when the event loop gets blocked often? to address this I’ve written, [node-chaos](https://github.com/i0natan/node-chaos-monkey) (alpha) which provides all sort of Node-related chaotic acts

❌ **Otherwise:** No escape here, Murphy’s law will hit your production without mercy
