# Introduction to the Case Study {#introduction-to-the-case-study .title}




For our case study we have chosen an airport---the UML Airport. Anyone
who has ever been on a flight will have no problems understanding our
example.

We will restrict our example to those areas of the airport that
passengers are in contact with during departure, meaning we will take a
closer look at *passenger check-in* and *boarding*. Figure 2.1
illustrates how passenger services can be distinguished from other areas
of the airport. It shows the various stages that passengers go through
until they are seated in the airplane, buckled up, and the plane is
ready to take off. Not all stages passengers go through are related to
passenger services. The stages that belong to passenger services are
framed and printed in italic font.

A sequence of steps like this is called a *scenario*. However, the
depicted scenario is only one of many possible scenarios. The following
exceptions are possible for passenger check-in and boarding:

-   The passenger only has carry-on luggage.
-   The passenger doesn't buy anything at the newsstand.
-   The passenger is running late and now has to check in as quickly as
    possible.
-   The passenger loses his or her boarding pass.
-   The passenger arrived by plane and merely has to change planes,
    meaning that he or she doesn't leave the transit area.
-   The passenger checks in, but falls asleep on an uncomfortable chair
    in the waiting area, and misses the departure of his or her flight,
    despite being called repeatedly.
-   The passenger doesn't get through passport inspection because his or
    her passport has expired.

The schematic illustration of the UML Airport in Figure 2.2 should help
you to understand the events of the case study better. Many areas around
the main passenger services are related in one or more ways to passenger
services. Some examples are:

-   Ticket sales
-   Newsstand
-   Duty-free shop
-   Passport inspection/immigration
-   Flight control
-   Information desk
-   Baggage check-in and transportation

Passenger services have to exchange data with some of these areas. They
also have to communicate with other areas of the airport. We will
introduce those areas when we discuss business models and models of
system integration. Therefore, the case study will be expanded further
in the following chapters.

UML Airport is a small airport and the case study has been purposely
kept simple. Anyone who has ever been on a flight should be able to
understand the examples.

The purpose of the case study is to provide a coherent example
throughout the chapters of this book. A few details of the case study
require further explanation:

-   The plane ticket consists of the actual ticket and up to four
    additional sections. The *ticket* is the little booklet that has a
    separate coupon for every part of the trip. For example, a ticket
    could contain a coupon for the flight from Zurich to Frankfurt, one
    for the flight from Frankfurt to London, and one for the return
    flight from London to Zurich. Each time at check-in the appropriate
    coupon will be exchanged for a boarding pass. The ticket always
    stays with the passenger.
-   We distinguish between a flight and a flight number. For instance, a
    *flight number* could be LH435 or LX016. It stands for a regular
    flight that occurs at a certain time from the departure airport to
    the destination airport. A *flight*, on the other hand, would be,
    for example, LH435 on 26th August, 2000. It is, so to speak, an
    execution of a flight number. A flight could be canceled due to bad
    weather. A flight number is used as long as the airline offers a
    certain flight regularly.
-   We differentiate between three options for check-in:
    -   **Normal check-in** with luggage at a normal check-in counter
    -   **Expres scheck-in** without luggage at a special check-in
        counter
    -   **Automated check-in** without luggage at a machine

# Introduction to the Case Study {#introduction-to-the-case-study-1 .title}




For our case study we have chosen an airport---the UML Airport. Anyone
who has ever been on a flight will have no problems understanding our
example.

We will restrict our example to those areas of the airport that
passengers are in contact with during departure, meaning we will take a
closer look at *passenger check-in* and *boarding*. Figure 2.1
illustrates how passenger services can be distinguished from other areas
of the airport. It shows the various stages that passengers go through
until they are seated in the airplane, buckled up, and the plane is
ready to take off. Not all stages passengers go through are related to
passenger services. The stages that belong to passenger services are
framed and printed in italic font.

A sequence of steps like this is called a *scenario*. However, the
depicted scenario is only one of many possible scenarios. The following
exceptions are possible for passenger check-in and boarding:

-   The passenger only has carry-on luggage.
-   The passenger doesn't buy anything at the newsstand.
-   The passenger is running late and now has to check in as quickly as
    possible.
-   The passenger loses his or her boarding pass.
-   The passenger arrived by plane and merely has to change planes,
    meaning that he or she doesn't leave the transit area.
-   The passenger checks in, but falls asleep on an uncomfortable chair
    in the waiting area, and misses the departure of his or her flight,
    despite being called repeatedly.
-   The passenger doesn't get through passport inspection because his or
    her passport has expired.

<figcaption>Figure 2.2 Schematic illustration of the UML
Airport</figcaption>
</figure>

The schematic illustration of the UML Airport in Figure 2.2 should help
you to understand the events of the case study better. Many areas around
the main passenger services are related in one or more ways to passenger
services. Some examples are:

-   Ticket sales
-   Newsstand
-   Duty-free shop
-   Passport inspection/immigration
-   Flight control
-   Information desk
-   Baggage check-in and transportation

Passenger services have to exchange data with some of these areas. They
also have to communicate with other areas of the airport. We will
introduce those areas when we discuss business models and models of
system integration. Therefore, the case study will be expanded further
in the following chapters.

UML Airport is a small airport and the case study has been purposely
kept simple. Anyone who has ever been on a flight should be able to
understand the examples.

The purpose of the case study is to provide a coherent example
throughout the chapters of this book. A few details of the case study
require further explanation:

-   The plane ticket consists of the actual ticket and up to four
    additional sections. The *ticket* is the little booklet that has a
    separate coupon for every part of the trip. For example, a ticket
    could contain a coupon for the flight from Zurich to Frankfurt, one
    for the flight from Frankfurt to London, and one for the return
    flight from London to Zurich. Each time at check-in the appropriate
    coupon will be exchanged for a boarding pass. The ticket always
    stays with the passenger.
-   We distinguish between a flight and a flight number. For instance, a
    *flight number* could be LH435 or LX016. It stands for a regular
    flight that occurs at a certain time from the departure airport to
    the destination airport. A *flight*, on the other hand, would be,
    for example, LH435 on 26th August, 2000. It is, so to speak, an
    execution of a flight number. A flight could be canceled due to bad
    weather. A flight number is used as long as the airline offers a
    certain flight regularly.
-   We differentiate between three options for check-in:
    -   **Normal check-in** with luggage at a normal check-in counter
    -   **Expres scheck-in** without luggage at a special check-in
        counter
    -   **Automated check-in** without luggage at a machine
