# Business Processes and Business Systems {#business-processes-and-business-systems .title}




## What is a Business Process?

Most people intuitively understand a *business process* to be a
*procedure* or *event* with the purpose of reaching a *goal*. When
looking at our UML Airport we can find many different business processes
and goals:

-   The goal of our passenger is to go on vacation. To achieve this
    goal, he has to book a flight and hotel, pack his bags, drive to the
    UML Airport, check in and board his airplane, exit the plane at his
    destination airport, go to the hotel, move into his room, and unpack
    his bags.
-   The owner of the newsstand at the UML Airport wants to sell her
    goods. For this, she buys items inexpensively and sells them to her
    customers at a higher price.
-   In order for passengers to check in at the UML Airport, an employee
    of passenger services accepts their tickets and luggage, inquires
    about their seat preferences, and uses an IT system. By the end of
    the procedure, the passengers receive their boarding passes on which
    their reserved seats and the appropriate gates are marked.

As you can see, business processes are often completed in several steps.
These steps are also referred to as *activities*, and have to be
completed in a predetermined order. The newsstand owner cannot sell any
goods unless she has purchased them beforehand.

A passenger packs his or her suitcase before he or she drives to the
airport. The employee of passenger services at the check-in counter can
only issue a boarding pass after check-in is completed (Figure 3.1):

Services” (simplified)</figcaption>
</figure>

Activities can run *sequentially* or in *parallel*. Thus, a passenger
can buy a bottle of whiskey in the duty-free shop, while his or her
luggage is being loaded into the Airbus 320 to London.

Individual activities can be organizationally *distributed*. The
check-in procedure takes place at the check-in counter and is performed
by an employee of passenger services, while the subsequent boarding
occurs at a different location and is performed by different employees
of passenger services.

Usually, the activities of a business process are interdependent. This
interdependency is created by the interaction of all the activities
belonging to a business process that pursue one common goal.

> passenger to go on vacation in an Airbus 320:
>
> -   Loading of the Airbus 320 with food and beverages
> -   Fueling of a Boeing 737
> -   Cleaning of the UML Airport restrooms
> -   Promotion of a UML Airport employee to vice-president

## Definition of the Workflow Management Coalition

Official definitions of the terms *process* and *business process* were
adopted by the *Workflow Management Coalition*. The following
definitions can be found in the glossary of the *[Workflow Reference
Model](http://www.wfmc.org)* of the Workflow Management Coalition:

> "A process is a coordinated (parallel and/or serial) set of process
> activity(s) that are connected in order to achieve a common goal. Such
> activities may consist of manual activity(s) and/or workflow
> activity(s)."

According to this definition, a process is a set of activities that
occur in a coordinated manner, either in parallel or one after another,
and that pursue one common goal. These activities can be performed
manually or when supported by an IT system.

> "A business process is a kind of process in the domain of business
> organizational structure and policy for the purpose of achieving
> business objectives."

## Business Systems

So far, we have explained business processes. Business processes are
dynamic in nature and involve activities. However, if we want to look at
the entire business system, we also have to consider the static aspects.
This involves, for instance, the organizational structures within which
business processes are conducted. This also involves various business
objects and information objects, such as tickets or orders. For the
static and dynamic aspects as a whole, we use the term business system.

In business terminology, a *business system* refers to the value-added
chain, which describes the value-added process, meaning the supply of
goods and services. A business can span one or several business systems.

Each business system, in itself, generates economic benefit. Thus, the
business administrative meaning of business system does not differ very
much from our use of the term business system. We also refer to the
'results' of a business system as 'functionality'.

For the analysis and modeling of a business system it is important to
define system limits. A business system that is to be modeled can span
an entire organization. In this case, we talk about an *organization
model*.

It is also possible to consider and model only a selected part of an
organization. In our case study, an IT system is to be integrated into
the Passenger Services operation. Therefore, it is sufficient to observe
this operation and to narrow the business system to Passenger Services
only.

*Passenger Services* is a division within the UML Airport, with
employees, organizational structure, an IT system, and defined tasks
(Figure 3.2). The surrounding divisions, such as baggage transportation
or catering, also belong to the UML Airport, but not to our business
system. So, we will treat them like other, external, business systems:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_15.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 3.2 System boundary during analysis of the business
system</figcaption>
</figure>

We are not interested in any of the external business systems as a
whole, but only in the *interfaces* between them and our business
system. For instance, the staff of passenger services need to know that
they have to transfer passengers' luggage to baggage transportation, so
that it can be loaded into the airplane. Of course, for this, passenger
services have to know *how* baggage transportation accepts luggage, so
that it can be made available accordingly. It is possible that the IT
systems of passenger services and baggage transportation will have to be
connected, meaning that interfaces will have to be created. On the other
hand, passenger services are completely unconcerned with how baggage
transportation is organized, and whether each suitcase is individually
carried across the runway or carts are used to transport luggage to the
airplane.

## Using UML to Model Business Processes and Business Systems

Before we move on to the modeling of business processes and business
systems with UML, we should ask ourselves whether UML is even suitable
for the modeling of business processes and business systems. For this
purpose we will take a look at UML's definition by OMG (Object
Management Group Inc.---the international association that promotes open
standards for object-oriented applications, which publishes each version
of UML that is submitted for standardization at
[www.omg.org](http://www.omg.org/)):

> \"The Unified Modeling Language is a visual language for specifying,
> constructing, and documenting the artifacts of systems\"---*UML
> Unified Modeling Language: Infrastructure, Version 2.0, Final Adopted
> Specifications*, September 2003.

This definition indicates that UML is a language for the modeling and
representation of systems in general, and thus, also of business
systems.

In any case, UML fulfills at least one of the requirements of
business-system modeling: it reflects various views of a business
system, in order to capture its different aspects. The various
standardized diagram types of UML meet this requirement, because every
diagram gives a different view of the modeled business system.

We reach the limits of UML when modeling extensive business process
projects, for instance, business process reengineering, or when modeling
entire organizations. However, for these kinds of projects powerful
methods and tools are available, such as *Architecture of Integrated IT
Systems* (ARIS). This doesn't mean that we want to keep anyone from
using UML for projects like that, although we recommend a thorough study
of the UML specifications (*OMG: Unified Modeling Language:
Superstructure, Version 2.0, Revised Final Adopted Specification*,
October 2004) and the use of CASE tools.

This text is tailored toward projects with the goal of developing IT
systems. Moreover, it is tailored toward projects for which a concern of
the business system is the assurance of the smooth integration of an IT
system. The following characteristics mark such projects:

-   Those business processes that are affected by the construction and
    integration of IT systems are considered.
-   Business-process modeling is not the focus of these projects.
    Instead, the model serves as the foundation for the construction and
    integration of IT systems. Business process integration can
    determine the success or failure of such a project; but the main
    task still is the construction of IT systems.
-   Because budgets are often tight, time investment in the methodology
    and language required for business-process modeling should not
    amount to more than 5-10% of the total project effort.

## Practical Tips for Modeling Business Processes

Often one is warned about the complexity of business process analysis
and business-process modeling. However, in our experience most business
processes are thoroughly understandable and controllable. Rather, the
lack of clarity and transparency makes them seem more complex than they
really are.

In many cases, existing business processes are documented poorly or not
at all. This can be traced to the fact that for many years most
functionalities were treated as 'islands' instead of parts of
comprehensive business processes. Because of that, the link between
activities---the process chain---is missing. If this overview is
missing, business processes seem complicated.

There are more hurdles to overcome if business processes are handled by
IT systems. Most of the time, documentation of the manual workflow that
is carried out between individual systems is not available. In other
cases, the functionality of IT systems is unknown because processes run
automatically, hidden somewhere in a black box, and only the input and
output are visible.

Existing business process architectures or reference models that already
exist can speed up and ease the modeling process. Comparing processes
with similar or identical processes in other organizations can be
helpful in identifying discrepancies and deriving possibilities for
improvement.

# Business Processes and Business Systems {#business-processes-and-business-systems-1 .title}




## What is a Business Process?

Most people intuitively understand a *business process* to be a
*procedure* or *event* with the purpose of reaching a *goal*. When
looking at our UML Airport we can find many different business processes
and goals:

-   The goal of our passenger is to go on vacation. To achieve this
    goal, he has to book a flight and hotel, pack his bags, drive to the
    UML Airport, check in and board his airplane, exit the plane at his
    destination airport, go to the hotel, move into his room, and unpack
    his bags.
-   The owner of the newsstand at the UML Airport wants to sell her
    goods. For this, she buys items inexpensively and sells them to her
    customers at a higher price.
-   In order for passengers to check in at the UML Airport, an employee
    of passenger services accepts their tickets and luggage, inquires
    about their seat preferences, and uses an IT system. By the end of
    the procedure, the passengers receive their boarding passes on which
    their reserved seats and the appropriate gates are marked.

As you can see, business processes are often completed in several steps.
These steps are also referred to as *activities*, and have to be
completed in a predetermined order. The newsstand owner cannot sell any
goods unless she has purchased them beforehand.

A passenger packs his or her suitcase before he or she drives to the
airport. The employee of passenger services at the check-in counter can
only issue a boarding pass after check-in is completed (Figure 3.1):

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_14.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 3.1 Activity of the business process “Passenger
Services” (simplified)</figcaption>
</figure>

Activities can run *sequentially* or in *parallel*. Thus, a passenger
can buy a bottle of whiskey in the duty-free shop, while his or her
luggage is being loaded into the Airbus 320 to London.

Individual activities can be organizationally *distributed*. The
check-in procedure takes place at the check-in counter and is performed
by an employee of passenger services, while the subsequent boarding
occurs at a different location and is performed by different employees
of passenger services.

Usually, the activities of a business process are interdependent. This
interdependency is created by the interaction of all the activities
belonging to a business process that pursue one common goal.

> Think about which of the following activities are not interdependent
> with our case study, because they do not pursue the goal of our
> passenger to go on vacation in an Airbus 320:
>
> -   Loading of the Airbus 320 with food and beverages
> -   Fueling of a Boeing 737
> -   Cleaning of the UML Airport restrooms
> -   Promotion of a UML Airport employee to vice-president

## Definition of the Workflow Management Coalition

Official definitions of the terms *process* and *business process* were
adopted by the *Workflow Management Coalition*. The following
definitions can be found in the glossary of the *[Workflow Reference
Model](http://www.wfmc.org)* of the Workflow Management Coalition:

> "A process is a coordinated (parallel and/or serial) set of process
> activity(s) that are connected in order to achieve a common goal. Such
> activities may consist of manual activity(s) and/or workflow
> activity(s)."

According to this definition, a process is a set of activities that
occur in a coordinated manner, either in parallel or one after another,
and that pursue one common goal. These activities can be performed
manually or when supported by an IT system.

> "A business process is a kind of process in the domain of business
> organizational structure and policy for the purpose of achieving
> business objectives."

## Business Systems

So far, we have explained business processes. Business processes are
dynamic in nature and involve activities. However, if we want to look at
the entire business system, we also have to consider the static aspects.
This involves, for instance, the organizational structures within which
business processes are conducted. This also involves various business
objects and information objects, such as tickets or orders. For the
static and dynamic aspects as a whole, we use the term business system.

In business terminology, a *business system* refers to the value-added
chain, which describes the value-added process, meaning the supply of
goods and services. A business can span one or several business systems.

Each business system, in itself, generates economic benefit. Thus, the
business administrative meaning of business system does not differ very
much from our use of the term business system. We also refer to the
'results' of a business system as 'functionality'.

For the analysis and modeling of a business system it is important to
define system limits. A business system that is to be modeled can span
an entire organization. In this case, we talk about an *organization
model*.

It is also possible to consider and model only a selected part of an
organization. In our case study, an IT system is to be integrated into
the Passenger Services operation. Therefore, it is sufficient to observe
this operation and to narrow the business system to Passenger Services
only.

*Passenger Services* is a division within the UML Airport, with
employees, organizational structure, an IT system, and defined tasks
(Figure 3.2). The surrounding divisions, such as baggage transportation
or catering, also belong to the UML Airport, but not to our business
system. So, we will treat them like other, external, business systems:

<figure class="image">
<img src="/files/sm/images/uml/img_15.jpg" />
<figcaption>Figure 3.2 System boundary during analysis of the business
system</figcaption>
</figure>

We are not interested in any of the external business systems as a
whole, but only in the *interfaces* between them and our business
system. For instance, the staff of passenger services need to know that
they have to transfer passengers' luggage to baggage transportation, so
that it can be loaded into the airplane. Of course, for this, passenger
services have to know *how* baggage transportation accepts luggage, so
that it can be made available accordingly. It is possible that the IT
systems of passenger services and baggage transportation will have to be
connected, meaning that interfaces will have to be created. On the other
hand, passenger services are completely unconcerned with how baggage
transportation is organized, and whether each suitcase is individually
carried across the runway or carts are used to transport luggage to the
airplane.

## Using UML to Model Business Processes and Business Systems

Before we move on to the modeling of business processes and business
systems with UML, we should ask ourselves whether UML is even suitable
for the modeling of business processes and business systems. For this
purpose we will take a look at UML's definition by OMG (Object
Management Group Inc.---the international association that promotes open
standards for object-oriented applications, which publishes each version
of UML that is submitted for standardization at
[www.omg.org](http://www.omg.org/)):

> \"The Unified Modeling Language is a visual language for specifying,
> constructing, and documenting the artifacts of systems\"---*UML
> Unified Modeling Language: Infrastructure, Version 2.0, Final Adopted
> Specifications*, September 2003.

This definition indicates that UML is a language for the modeling and
representation of systems in general, and thus, also of business
systems.

In any case, UML fulfills at least one of the requirements of
business-system modeling: it reflects various views of a business
system, in order to capture its different aspects. The various
standardized diagram types of UML meet this requirement, because every
diagram gives a different view of the modeled business system.

We reach the limits of UML when modeling extensive business process
projects, for instance, business process reengineering, or when modeling
entire organizations. However, for these kinds of projects powerful
methods and tools are available, such as *Architecture of Integrated IT
Systems* (ARIS). This doesn't mean that we want to keep anyone from
using UML for projects like that, although we recommend a thorough study
of the UML specifications (*OMG: Unified Modeling Language:
Superstructure, Version 2.0, Revised Final Adopted Specification*,
October 2004) and the use of CASE tools.

This text is tailored toward projects with the goal of developing IT
systems. Moreover, it is tailored toward projects for which a concern of
the business system is the assurance of the smooth integration of an IT
system. The following characteristics mark such projects:

-   Those business processes that are affected by the construction and
    integration of IT systems are considered.
-   Business-process modeling is not the focus of these projects.
    Instead, the model serves as the foundation for the construction and
    integration of IT systems. Business process integration can
    determine the success or failure of such a project; but the main
    task still is the construction of IT systems.
-   Because budgets are often tight, time investment in the methodology
    and language required for business-process modeling should not
    amount to more than 5-10% of the total project effort.

## Practical Tips for Modeling Business Processes

Often one is warned about the complexity of business process analysis
and business-process modeling. However, in our experience most business
processes are thoroughly understandable and controllable. Rather, the
lack of clarity and transparency makes them seem more complex than they
really are.

In many cases, existing business processes are documented poorly or not
at all. This can be traced to the fact that for many years most
functionalities were treated as 'islands' instead of parts of
comprehensive business processes. Because of that, the link between
activities---the process chain---is missing. If this overview is
missing, business processes seem complicated.

There are more hurdles to overcome if business processes are handled by
IT systems. Most of the time, documentation of the manual workflow that
is carried out between individual systems is not available. In other
cases, the functionality of IT systems is unknown because processes run
automatically, hidden somewhere in a black box, and only the input and
output are visible.

Existing business process architectures or reference models that already
exist can speed up and ease the modeling process. Comparing processes
with similar or identical processes in other organizations can be
helpful in identifying discrepancies and deriving possibilities for
improvement.
