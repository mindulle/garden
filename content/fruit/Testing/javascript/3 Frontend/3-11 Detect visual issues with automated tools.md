## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 3.11 Detect visual issues with automated tools

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Setup automated tools to capture UI screenshots when changes are presented and detect visual issues like content overlapping or breaking. This ensures that not only the right data is prepared but also the user can conveniently see it. This technique is not widely adopted, our testing mindset leans toward functional tests but it's the visuals what the user experience and with so many device types it's very easy to overlook some nasty UI bug. Some free tools can provide the basics - generate and save screenshots for the inspection of human eyes. While this approach might be sufficient for small apps, it's flawed as any other manual testing that demands human labor anytime something changes. On the other hand, it's quite challenging to detect UI issues automatically due to the lack of clear definition - this is where the field of 'Visual Regression' chime in and solve this puzzle by comparing old UI with the latest changes and detect differences. Some OSS/free tools can provide some of this functionality (e.g. [wraith](https://github.com/BBC-News/wraith), [PhantomCSS](<[https://github.com/HuddleEng/PhantomCSS](https://github.com/HuddleEng/PhantomCSS)>) but might charge significant setup time. The commercial line of tools (e.g. [Applitools](https://applitools.com/), [Percy.io](https://percy.io/)) takes is a step further by smoothing the installation and packing advanced features like management UI, alerting, smart capturing by eliminating 'visual noise' (e.g. ads, animations) and even root cause analysis of the DOM/CSS changes that led to the issue
