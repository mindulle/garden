## ⚪ ️5.6 Constantly inspect for vulnerable dependencies

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Even the most reputable dependencies such as Express have known vulnerabilities. This can get easily tamed using community tools such as [npm audit](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/running-a-security-audit), or commercial tools like [snyk](https://snyk.io/) (offer also a free community version). Both can be invoked from your CI on every build

❌ **Otherwise:** Keeping your code clean from vulnerabilities without dedicated tools will require to constantly follow online publications about new threats. Quite tedious
