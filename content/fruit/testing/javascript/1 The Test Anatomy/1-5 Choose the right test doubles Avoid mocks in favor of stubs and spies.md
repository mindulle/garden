## ‚ö™ Ô∏è Ô∏è1.5 Choose the right test doubles: Avoid mocks in favor of stubs and spies

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Test doubles are a necessary evil because they are coupled to the application internals, yet some provide immense value (<a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html" data-href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">[Read here a reminder about test doubles: mocks vs stubs vs spies](https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html)</a>).

Before using test doubles, ask a very simple question: Do I use it to test functionality that appears, or could appear, in the requirements document? If not, it‚Äôs a white-box testing smell.

For example, if you want to test that your app behaves reasonably when the payment service is down, you might stub the payment service and trigger some ‚ÄòNo Response‚Äô return to ensure that the unit under test returns the right value. This checks our application behavior/response/outcome under certain scenarios. You might also use a spy to assert that an email was sent when that service is down‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis is again a behavioral check which is likely to appear in a requirements doc (‚ÄúSend an email if payment couldn‚Äôt be saved‚Äù). On the flip side, if you mock the Payment service and ensure that it was called with the right JavaScript types‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthen your test is focused on internal things that have nothing to do with the application functionality and are likely to change frequently
<br/>

‚ùå **Otherwise:** Any refactoring of code mandates searching for all the mocks in the code and updating accordingly. Tests become a burden rather than a helpful friend

### :thumbsdown: Anti-pattern example: Mocks focus on the internals

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/üîß%20Example%20using%20Sinon-blue.svg "Examples with Sinon")

```javascript
it("When a valid product is about to be deleted, ensure data access DAL was called once, with the right product and right config", async () => {
  //Assume we already added a product
  const dataAccessMock = sinon.mock(DAL);
  //hmmm BAD: testing the internals is actually our main goal here, not just a side-effect
  dataAccessMock
    .expects("deleteProduct")
    .once()
    .withArgs(DBConfig, theProductWeJustAdded, true, false);
  new ProductService().deletePrice(theProductWeJustAdded);
  dataAccessMock.verify();
});
```

<br/>

### :clap:Doing It Right Example: spies are focused on testing the requirements but as a side-effect are unavoidably touching to the internals

```javascript
it("When a valid product is about to be deleted, ensure an email is sent", async () => {
  //Assume we already added here a product
  const spy = sinon.spy(Emailer.prototype, "sendEmail");
  new ProductService().deletePrice(theProductWeJustAdded);
  //hmmm OK: we deal with internals? Yes, but as a side effect of testing the requirements (sending an email)
  expect(spy.calledOnce).to.be.true;
});
```
