## ⚪ ️4.4 Preventing test code issues with Test linters

:white_check_mark: **Do:** A set of ESLint plugins were built specifically for inspecting the tests code patterns and discover issues. For example, [eslint-plugin-mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-mocha) will warn when a test is written at the global level (not a son of a describe() statement) or when tests are [skipped](https://mochajs.org/#inclusive-tests) which might lead to a false belief that all tests are passing. Similarly, [eslint-plugin-jest](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest) can, for example, warn when a test has no assertions at all (not checking anything)

<br/>

❌ **Otherwise:** Seeing 90% code coverage and 100% green tests will make your face wear a big smile only until you realize that many tests aren’t asserting for anything and many test suites were just skipped. Hopefully, you didn’t deploy anything based on this false observation

### :thumbsdown: Anti-Pattern Example: A test case full of errors, luckily all are caught by Linters

```javascript
describe("Too short description", () => {
  const userToken = userService.getDefaultToken() // *error:no-setup-in-describe, use hooks (sparingly) instead
  it("Some description", () => {});//* error: valid-test-description. Must include the word "Should" + at least 5 words
});

it.skip("Test name", () => {// *error:no-skipped-tests, error:error:no-global-tests. Put tests only under describe or suite
  expect("somevalue"); // error:no-assert
});

it("Test name", () => {// *error:no-identical-title. Assign unique titles to tests
});
```

</details>
