## Inheritance (object-oriented programming)
> In object-oriented programming, **inheritance** is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object (prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), retaining similar implementation.

\- byÂ *[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming))*

## Example Sentence
- *wikipedia: **Inheritance** is used to co-relate two or more classes to each other.*
- *wikipedia: **Inheritance** is similar to but distinct from subtyping. Subtyping enables a given type to be substituted for another type or abstraction and is said to establish an is-a relationship between the subtype and some existing abstraction, either implicitly or explicitly, depending on language support.*
