## Cheating
> **Cheating**, in the context of behavior change strategies, refers to *creating shortcuts and loopholes* within a designed system, in order to overcome any obstacles users may face while achieving their goals.

### Designing for Cheating
> When designing cheat mechanisms in your UX, consider the following best practices

| Best practice                       | Concerns                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Balance**                         | **_Avoiding excessive exploitation_** that could lead to unearned rewards or trivializing the user’s experience. |
| **Limited Access**                  | Cheating **_should not become the default behavior_** or the most commonly used strategy in your design.         |
| **Documentation and communication** | Making users aware of cheat options can help you foster an environment where users knowingly bend the rules.     |
| **Monitoring**                      | If cheating becomes too widespread or harmful, consider tweaking the system and addressing any unintended consequences.                                                                                                                 |

Remember, the goal is to **make the experience enjoyable and rewarding**, *not to provide users with a way to cheat* their way to success.
