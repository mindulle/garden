## Call to Action
> A **Call to Action (CTA)** is a UX pattern that encourages users to take a specific action on a website, app, or other digital product. (...) **CTA**s can come in various forms, including buttons, links, images, or text.

## Best Practices
- Limit the number of **CTA**s on a single page or screen to maintain focus and avoid confusion.
- Ensure the **CTA** is relevant to the content and user experience.
- Test different **CTA** variations, placements, and designs to determine which is most effective for your target audience.

By incorporating **CTA**s into your UX design, you can create a more engaging, user-friendly experience that helps guide users through your product and ultimately drives them to take the desired actions.
