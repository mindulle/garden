Section 0️⃣: The Golden Rule

⚪️ 0 The Golden Rule: Design for lean testing
✅ Do: Testing code is not production-code - Design it to be short, dead-simple, flat, and delightful to work with. One should look at a test and get the intent instantly.

See, our minds are already occupied with our main job - the production code. There is no 'headspace' for additional complexity. Should we try to squeeze yet another sus-system into our poor brain it will slow the team down which works against the reason we do testing. Practically this is where many teams just abandon testing.

The tests are an opportunity for something else - a friendly assistant, co-pilot, that delivers great value for a small investment. Science tells us that we have two brain systems: system 1 is used for effortless activities like driving a car on an empty road and system 2 is meant for complex and conscious operations like solving a math equation. Design your test for system 1, when looking at test code it should feel as easy as modifying an HTML document and not like solving 2X(17 × 24).

This can be achieved by selectively cherry-picking techniques, tools, and test targets that are cost-effective and provide great ROI. Test only as much as needed, and strive to keep it nimble, sometimes it's even worth dropping some tests and trading reliability for agility and simplicity.
