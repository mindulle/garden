In software development, stubs are placeholder implementations or simplified versions of software components or modules. Stubs are used to simulate the behavior of real components or to provide a basic interface for testing and development purposes. Here are some common types of stubs:

1.  Method Stubs: Method stubs are used when testing or developing code that depends on external methods or functions. These stubs provide a basic implementation of the method or function with predefined return values. Method stubs help isolate and test specific sections of code.
    
2.  Service Stubs: Service stubs are used when interacting with external services or APIs. They simulate the behavior of the actual service or API by providing predefined responses to specific requests. Service stubs allow developers to test their code's interaction with external services without relying on the real service.
    
3.  Module Stubs: Module stubs are placeholder implementations of software modules or components that are not fully developed or available. They provide a basic structure and interface to allow other parts of the software to be developed and tested in parallel.
    
4.  Test Stubs: Test stubs, also known as test doubles, are used in unit testing to replace dependencies on external components. Test stubs mimic the behavior of the real components and allow developers to control the input and output to facilitate testing of specific scenarios.
    
5.  Data Stubs: Data stubs are used to provide test data or simulate data sources. They can be used to populate databases or provide predefined datasets for testing purposes.
    
6.  UI Stubs: UI stubs, also known as mockups or wireframes, are used in user interface (UI) design and development. They provide a visual representation of the user interface without any functional implementation. UI stubs help designers and developers gather feedback and validate UI concepts before the actual implementation.
    

These different types of stubs serve various purposes in software development, allowing developers to test, develop, and integrate software components effectively.

In software development, stub documents refer to placeholder or preliminary versions of documentation that are created to provide temporary or incomplete information. These documents can serve different purposes depending on the specific needs of the development process. Here are some types of stub documents:

1.  API Stub Documentation: API stub documentation provides a basic outline or skeleton of the expected structure and content for the final API documentation. It may include placeholder descriptions of API endpoints, request and response formats, and example usage scenarios. API stub documentation helps developers understand the planned structure and functionality of the API before the complete documentation is available.
    
2.  Placeholder Documentation: Placeholder documentation acts as a temporary placeholder for comprehensive documentation. It may contain basic information about the software, such as a brief overview, installation instructions, and known limitations. Placeholder documentation helps developers get started with using or integrating the software while the full documentation is being developed.
    
3.  Skeleton Documentation: Skeleton documentation provides a high-level framework or structure for the complete documentation. It may include section headings, table of contents, and placeholders for content that will be filled in later. Skeleton documentation helps establish the overall structure and organization of the final documentation, making it easier to progressively add detailed information.
    
4.  Template Documentation: Template documentation provides a standardized format or template for creating consistent documentation. It includes sections, headings, and formatting guidelines that developers can follow when creating the actual documentation. Template documentation ensures uniformity and helps streamline the process of creating comprehensive documentation.
    
5.  Partial Documentation: Partial documentation includes incomplete sections or partially filled-in content for specific areas of the software or API. It may provide information on certain features, functions, or usage examples, while other sections remain blank or contain placeholders. Partial documentation allows developers to access and utilize the available information while additional content is being developed.
    

It's important to note that stub documents are temporary and intended to be replaced or expanded upon with more detailed and complete documentation as the development progresses. They serve as placeholders or starting points to provide some level of information or guidance during the software development lifecycle.
