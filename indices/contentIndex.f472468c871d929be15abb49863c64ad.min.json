Visit your raindrop collection via the website, e.g. https://app.raindrop.io/my/15660833\r\n2. The string of numbers after '/my/' is your collection ID\r\n3. There are a few special collection IDs which can be used:\r\n\r\n   | ID  | Collection    |\r\n   |:---:| ------------- |\r\n   |  0  | All bookmarks |\r\n   | -1  | Unsorted      |\r\n   | -99 | Trash              |\r\n\r\n## Plugin Setup\r\nAfter installing the plugin, you will need to setup a new app in your Raindrop account. Once you have completed this step, you can use your new app's test account key for access to the API.\r\n\r\n### Raindrop Test Token\r\n\r\nI elected to not use the OAuth mechanism that the Raindrop API offers to avoid maintaining my own middleware.\r\n\r\n1. Access the [Integrations](https://app.raindrop.io/settings/integrations) section of your Raindrop account\r\n2. Click \"Create new app\"\r\n3. Copy the \"Test token\"\r\n\r\nIn the plugin settings you can paste this test key to interact without needing to directly login with Raindrop.\r\n\r\n### Bookmark List Refresh Interval\r\n\r\nYour bookmarks will automatically refresh from Raindrop in the background for the current note. Set the number of minutes here for how often to check Raindrop for new links in the search codeblock of any active notes.\r\n\r\n## Recipes\r\n\r\n### Daily Bookmarks\r\n\r\nI use this query in my daily notes template. The date variable is transcluded when the page is created, giving you a list of bookmarks you created that day. It can be a helpful way to recall the things you read or researched that day.\r\n\r\n\u003cpre\u003e\r\n```raindrop\r\nsearch: created:{{DATE:yyyy-MM-DD}}\r\n```\r\n\u003c/pre\u003e","lastmodified":"2023-07-01T03:56:44.355767248Z","tags":[]},"/Flower/Flower":{"title":"ðŸšªFlower","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-07-01T03:56:44.395770334Z","tags":["entry-point"]},"/Fruit/Fruit":{"title":"ðŸšªTree","content":"# TL;DR\n- one `folder` per `when`\n- one `folder` per `where`","lastmodified":"2023-07-01T03:56:44.395770334Z","tags":["entry-point"]},"/Seed/CSS/CSS":{"title":"ðŸšªCSS","content":"# Description\n\u003e Cascading Style SheetsÂ (CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in aÂ markup language like HTML.
