UI stubs help designers and developers gather feedback and validate UI concepts before the actual implementation.</li></ol><p>These different types of stubs serve various purposes in software development, allowing developers to test, develop, and integrate software components effectively.</p><blockquote><p>1 / 1</p><p>type of stub documents</p></blockquote><p>ChatGPTChatGPT</p><p>1 / 1</p><p>In software development, stub documents refer to placeholder or preliminary versions of documentation that are created to provide temporary or incomplete information. These documents can serve different purposes depending on the specific needs of the development process. Here are some types of stub documents:</p><ol><li>API Stub Documentation: API stub documentation provides a basic outline or skeleton of the expected structure and content for the final API documentation. It may include placeholder descriptions of API endpoints, request and response formats, and example usage scenarios. API stub documentation helps developers understand the planned structure and functionality of the API before the complete documentation is available.</li><li>Placeholder Documentation: Placeholder documentation acts as a temporary placeholder for comprehensive documentation. It may contain basic information about the software, such as a brief overview, installation instructions, and known limitations. Placeholder documentation helps developers get started with using or integrating the software while the full documentation is being developed.</li><li>Skeleton Documentation: Skeleton documentation provides a high-level framework or structure for the complete documentation. It may include section headings, table of contents, and placeholders for content that will be filled in later. Skeleton documentation helps establish the overall structure and organization of the final documentation, making it easier to progressively add detailed information.</li><li>Template Documentation: Template documentation provides a standardized format or template for creating consistent documentation. It includes sections, headings, and formatting guidelines that developers can follow when creating the actual documentation. Template documentation ensures uniformity and helps streamline the process of creating comprehensive documentation.</li><li>Partial Documentation: Partial documentation includes incomplete sections or partially filled-in content for specific areas of the software or API. It may provide information on certain features, functions, or usage examples, while other sections remain blank or contain placeholders. Partial documentation allows developers to access and utilize the available information while additional content is being developed.</li></ol><p>It&rsquo;s important to note that stub documents are temporary and intended to be replaced or expanded upon with more detailed and complete documentation as the development progresses. They serve as placeholders or starting points to provide some level of information or guidance during the software development lifecycle.</p><blockquote><p>1 / 1</p><p>Provided type of stubs, such as Stack overflow qna, blog post, official document, etc&mldr;</p></blockquote><p>ChatGPTChatGPT</p><p>1 / 1</p><p>Apologies for the confusion.
